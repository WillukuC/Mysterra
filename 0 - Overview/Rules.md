# Proposed Rules
## Take 10
When you’re not in a rush, not being threatened or distracted (when you’re outside an encounter), and when you’re dealing with a mundane task, you can choose to take 10. Instead of rolling a d20, determine your skill check result as if you had rolled the average (10). When you take 10, your result equals your skill modifiers (including one-half your level) + 10. For mundane tasks, taking 10 usually results in a success.
## Monster Knowledge Check
Monster Knowledge: No action required—either you know the answer or you don’t.
- DC: See the table.
- Success: You identify a creature as well as its type, typical temperament, and keywords. Higher results give you information about the creature’s powers, resistances, and vulnerabilities.
- Failure: You don’t recall any pertinent information. The DM might allow you to make a new check if further information comes to light.
