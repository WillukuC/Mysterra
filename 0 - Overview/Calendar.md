## Years
The years of an era are not set in stone - there is no rule to how long an era must last, for they are dictated by cataclysmic events. An era can last anywhere from a moment to an eternity. Years have 364 days each.
## Moones
As Mysterra revolves around its star, it passes through the 12 Lairs of the Thediac, which are in reality demiplanes. Each of these demiplanes is presided over by a different deity, whose powers begin to influence the everyday lives of Mysterrans for as long as Mysterra travels through their demiplane. This time is known as a moone or a month, which lasts 28 days, which the Mysterrans have divided into 4 workweeks of 7 days each.

Every few moones, a week-long festival takes place. These festivals take place four times a year.

| 2       | Uthwilun  | [[Varda]]      | Moon of Birth    | Athamm | The first full moon of the year is said to bestow a blessing of vitality and longevity to newborns and pregnant women.

| 3       | Opolun    | [[Renare]]     | Moon of Rain     | Athamm | This is the month of rejuvenation and rebirth, and as such, any plant or animal that dies during this month has a chance to spring back to life as a new form, stronger and more resilient.                                                   |
| (**2**) | Rikfest   |                |                  |        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4       | Achulun   | [[Gront]]      | Moon of Greenery | Athamm | Seeds sown during this month are said to grow faster and stronger than those sown in any other month.

| 5       | Iolun     | [[Helig]]      | The Holy Moon    | Morne  | The gods may choose to directly communicate with their followers through visions, dreams, or signs.

| 9       | Lokilun   | [[Skordare]]   | Moon of Decay    | Edar   | During this month, the natural order of life and death is disrupted; diseases and decay spread more easily, making this a dangerous time to be near corpses or decayed matter.                                                                |

| 11      | Thurilun  | [[Forsvar]]    | Moon of Kinship  | Ferinn | Those who spend time together during this month find that they become closer than ever before: shared dreams, telepathic communication, or a literal glowing bond between individuals.                                                        |
