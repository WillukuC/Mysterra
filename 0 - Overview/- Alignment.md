## Alignments in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. 
Good-aligned gods who created races gave them the free will to choose their moral paths, viewing that good without free will is slavery.
Evil-aligned gods, however, made races to serve them. They have strong inborn tendencies to match the nature of their gods. 
Alignment is an essential part of the nature of outsiders like [[Celestial|celestials]] and [[Fiend|fiends]]. A devil doesn't choose lawful evil, nor does it tend toward lawful evil. It is the very essence of lawful evil. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought have no alignment: they are unaligned. They are incapable of making a moral or ethical decision and act according to their wild nature. Sharks are savage predators, but they aren't evil; they have no alignment.
