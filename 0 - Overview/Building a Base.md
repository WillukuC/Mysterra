## Obtaining Specialists
In order to hire either of these classes of persons it is necessary to do one or both of the following: 
- Post notices in conspicuous places, stating the positions open and who is offering such employ;
- or have servitors circulate in public places, seeking such persons as are desired. 
The weekly cost of either method is from 100–600 Gold Pieces. The referee must determine the probability of the success of the attempt based upon the generosity of the offer made and so on.
## Rumors, Information, and Legends
Such activity as advertising will certainly gain the notice of the locals and begin a chain of rumors. So will almost any other unusual activity. Even the departure of a party from a town is likely to be noticed. Obtaining such news is usually merely a matter of making the rounds of the local taverns and inns, buying a round of drinks (10–60 Gold Pieces), slipping the barman a few coins (1–10 Gold Pieces) and learning what is going on. Misinformation is up to the referee. Legends will be devised by the referee as the need arises, but they are generally insinuated in order to lead players into some form of activity or warn them of a coming event.
