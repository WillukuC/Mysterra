	- [ ] Paths
		- [ ] The 22 connecting paths on the Tree of Life represent the connections between the Sephiroth. Each path is associated with a specific Hebrew letter, Tarot card, and a range of meanings and correspondences. Hermetic Qabalists see the cards of the tarot as keys to the Tree of Life. The 22 cards including the 21 Trumps plus the Fool or Zero card are often called the "Major Arcana or "Greater Mysteries" and are seen as corresponding to the 22 Hebrew letters and the 22 paths of the Tree; the ace to ten in each suit correspond to the ten Sephiroth in the four Qabalistic worlds; and the sixteen court cards relate to the classical elements in the four worlds.While the sephiroth describe the nature of divinity, the paths between them describe ways of knowing the Divine.
		- [ ] Path of the Flaming Sword
			- [ ] The **path of the flaming sword** refers to the flaming sword which God put to guard the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve were cast out. It is a concept in Kabbalah which represents the order in which the ten sefirot were created. The path emanates from the Ein Sof, the boundless source of divinity, begins at Kether (The Crown) and ends at Malkuth (The Kingdom), where the physical world manifests.

			- [ ] It is unclear exactly when human beings first discovered the magic. It was after the year 60,000 BC but before the year 12,000 BC. By the year 12,000 BC, magic was in common use by humans, and the world was segregated based on the ability to wield it: the Enlightened Ones, who could use magic, and the Earthbound Ones "Earthbound Ones"), who could not. The Enlightened lived on the floating islands of the Kingdom of Zeal, while the Earthbound huddled in caves on the world's surface - looked down upon by the Enlightened and often being recruited forcefully to do the latter's will.
