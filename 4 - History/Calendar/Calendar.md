### Years
The years of an era are not set in stone - there is no rule to how long an era must last, for they are dictated by cataclysmic events. An era can last anywhere from a moment to an eternity. Years have 360 days each.
### Moones
As Mysterra revolves around its star, it passes through the 8 [[Lairs of the Thediac]], which are in reality demiplanes. Each of these demiplanes is presided over by a different deity, whose powers begin to influence the everyday lives of Mysterrans for as long as Mysterra travels through their demiplane. This time is known as a moone or a month, which lasts 45 days, which the Mysterrans have divided into four-and-a-half workweeks of 10 days each, also known as a tenday.
