Before the beginning, there existed [[Absolute Nothingness]], a vast expanse of empty space, devoid of any existence.<br>
From this profound Void emerged a sudden spark, a presence yet unnamed, but destined to be known as [[the All-Creator]].<br>
The All-Creator traversed the Nothingness, silently observing the void surrounding it. There had never been existence before, but now it was, and it would endure.<br>
It moved for a timeless moment, or perhaps an eternity, and then it began to shape the multiverse.<br>
At first, the multiverse was desolate and barren, devoid of matter and life, yet it was distinct from the Void; it was something.<br>
The All-Creator began to weave the planes that would comprise the multiverse. The first plane, the [[Plane of Air]], was the simplest to shape, for Air was the closest to the Nothingness.<br>
Air assumed countless forms: boundless skies of azure, gray, and rose; tranquil clouds of white and tempestuous clouds of gray; gentle breezes and tempestuous storms.<br>
The second plane, the [[Plane of Water]], became an infinite ocean with no depths or surface, no shores where waves might break.<br>
Water, akin to Air, manifested in diverse guises: crystal-blue Waters, tropical emerald Waters, and obsidian-black Waters at the unfathomable depths, where light could not penetrate.<br>
Opposite Water stood the third plane: the [[Plane of Fire]], the embodiment of heat. Much like Water, Fire stretched into the endless.<br>
Fire transformed into soothing flames and roaring infernos; flames danced from crimson to amber to gold to incandescent white, each a frenzied entity.<br>
The fourth plane, the [[Plane of Earth]], was created in contrast to Air. It was a solid, unyielding plane, distinct from the others, yet not devoid of motion.<br>
Infinite stretches of earthen soil; cold, gray stones; warm, golden sands; and crystals of myriad hues, forged by immeasurable pressures.<br>
These four planes - Air, Water, Fire, and Earth - would become known as the [[Elemental Planes]].<br>
The All-Creator observed its handiwork for another eternal moment and then fashioned two new planes, the twin [[Energetic Planes|Planes of Energy]], which would shape life within the multiverse.<br>
The first was the [[Plane of Positive Energy]], which bestowed life energy and healing. The second was the [[Plane of Negative Energy]], harboring the forces of death and decay.<br>
As the All-Creator labored upon the Energetic Planes, the four Elemental Planes began to shift and merge into new forms, untouched and unguided by their creator.<br>
The boundary between Air and Water congealed, forming a vast wall of ice, soon to be known as the [[Plane of Ice]].<br>
Water softened Earth, rendering it malleable and formless, no longer rigid as before. This birthed the [[Plane of Ooze]].<br>
On the opposite end of Earth, Fire melted it with searing heat, creating a seething sea that would become the [[Plane of Magma]].<br>
In the midst of Fire, Air was consumed with such intensity that it turned ashen and sooty, polluting itself and giving rise to the [[Plane of Smoke]].<br>
These four planes came to be called the [[Para-Elemental Planes]], ancillary realms at the borders of the Elemental Planes.<br>
But the melding did not halt at the boundaries of the Elemental Planes. The elemental forces began to merge with the newly formed Energetic Planes.<br>
Positive Energy contributed to the creation of the [[Plane of Lightning]], [[Plane of Steam]], [[Plane of Radiance]], and [[Plane of Minerals]]. In contrast, Negative Energy played a part in birthing the [[Plane of Vacuum]], [[Plane of Salt]], [[Plane of Ash]], and [[Plane of Dust]].<br>
These eight planes were known as the [[Quasi-Elemental Planes]], intermediary realms between the Elemental and Energetic.<br>
At the outer fringes of the Elemental, a chaotic realm arose, where the elements clashed and churned incessantly. This realm would be known as the [[Elemental Chaos]], shapeless and formless, enveloping the other planes.<br>
These planes would later be called the [[Inner Planes]], although at this moment, they remained nameless.<br>
Towards the inner periphery of the Elemental, a different transformation occurred: the [[First World]] emerged, born from the very fabric of the Elemental Planes.<br>
They converged to form [[Crystal Spheres]], separated by the [[Phlogiston]]. Within each Sphere lay worlds, separated by [[Wildspace]].<br>
Observing the changes unfolding within the planes, the All-Creator formed a final plane to bind the Inner Planes together, restraining further shifts. This plane was the [[Ether]], a metaphysical realm permitting passage between planes.<br>
With the newfound tranquility of the planes, the All-Creator watched over them for yet another eternal instant.
