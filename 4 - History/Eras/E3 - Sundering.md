Deities who were born during [[E0 - Genesis|the Genesis]] deem [[Initium|First World]] too bright, and split the excess of light off into [[Faerie]]. [[Shar]] took the Shadows of the First World and sundered them into their own plane, creating [[Umbra]]. These Planes are, respectively, moved closer metaphysically to the [[Vita]] and the [[Mors]]. This causes the “Lesser Races” in each Faerie and Umbra to mutate, becoming the precursor to the Fey and the Undead.
