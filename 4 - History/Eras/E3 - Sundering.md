Deities who were born during [[E0 - Genesis|the Genesis]] deem [[First World|First World]] too bright, and split the excess of light off into [[The Faeri]]. Others deemed it too dark, and split the excess shadow into [[The Shadow]]. These Planes are, respectively, moved closer metaphysically to the [[Plane of Positive Energy]] and the [[Plane of Negative Energy]]. This causes the “Lesser Races” in each the Faeri and the Shadow to mutate, becoming the precursor to the Fey and the Undead.
