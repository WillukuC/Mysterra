# Description
people of towns and cities take pride in how civilized they are as if denying one's nature is a mark of superiority
civilization is not a virtue but a sign of weakness
the strong embrace their animal nature, keen instincts, primal physicality, ferocious rage
uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds
thrive in the wilds of their homelands (tundra, jungle, grasslands)
come alive in the chaos of combat
enter a berserk state where rage takes over, granting superhuman strength and resilience
can draw on the reservoir a few times without resting, but they are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise

not every person deemed a "barbarian" by civilized society has the barbarian class
a true barbarian is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town and they play a similar role as a protector of the people, and a leader in times of war
life in wild places is fraught with peril (rival tribes, deadly weather, terrifying monsters)
barbarians charge headlong into that danger so their people don't have to
courage in the face of danger makes for good adventurers
# Primal Paths
rage burns in every barbarian's heart, driving them towards greatness
different barbarians have different sources
for some, internal reservoir where pain, grief, anger are forged into a fury
others see it as a spiritual blessing, or a gift of a totem animal
## Path of the Berserker
rage is a means to an end, which is violence
path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood
thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being
## Path of the Totem Warrior
this path is a spiritual journey
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, inspiration
totem spirit fills barbarian with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to the rage
most tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan, so it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist
