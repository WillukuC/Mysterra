# Description
divine magic is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world
clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects
gods don't grant power to everyone who seeks it, but to those chosen to fulfill a higher calling
harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training
clerics might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes
combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes
provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, call down flames form heaven
combat training lets them wade into melee with the power of gods on their side

not every acolyte or officiant as a temple or shrine is a cleric
some priests are called to simplicity, carrying out god's will through prayer and sacrifice instead of magic and strength of arms
true clerics are rare in most hierarchies
clerics take up adventuring because a god demands it; pursuing the goals of gods includes braving dangers beyond the walls, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs
expected to protect the deities' worshipers
# Divine Domains
every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a domain
all the domains over which a deity has influence is a portfolio
## Knowledge Domain
value learning and understanding above all
some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries, universities
some promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention
some hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves
some promise their followers tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse
followers study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into secret places, and learn all they can
## Life Domain
focuses on the vibrant positive energy that sustains all life
promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, driving away the forces of death and undeath
## Light Domain
promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, beauty
deities of the sun, tireless sentinels who see through every deception, deities of beauty and artistry
clerics of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision
charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness
## Nature Domain
nature gods are as varied as the natural world itself
from inscrutable gods of deep forests to friendly deities of particular springs and groves
druids revere nature as a whole, but nature clerics are chosen champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular god
these clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their god
## Tempest Domain
these gods govern storms, sea, and sky
gods of lightning and thunder, of earthquakes, of fire, and certain gods of violence, physical strength and courage
known for swift justice
for seafaring people they are ocean deities and patrons of sailors
clerics inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep them on the path to righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath
## Trickery Domain
mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to order
patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, liberators
clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, flouting hollow traditions
prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than confrontation
## War Domain
war has many manifestations
can make heroes of ordinary people
can be desperate and horrific with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing excellence and courage
gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for great deeds
clerics excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers
gods are champions of honor and chivalry, or gods of destruction and pillage, or gods of conquest and domination
others take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance
