# Description
raw magic is a part of every sorcerer, it suffuses body, mind and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped
some wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline, others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them
the appearance of a sorcerer's powers is wildly unpredictable
some bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer every generation, in others every individual is a sorcerer
most of the time, sorcery appears as an apparent fluke
some are unaware of the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their lives (touch of a demon, blessing of a dryad at birth, taste of water from a mysterious spring, gift of a deity, exposure to the elemental forces of the inner plane, maddening chaos of Limbo, glimpse into the inner workings of reality)
no use for spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore like a wizard, nor rely on a patron to grant spells like a warlock
learn to channel and harness their own inborn magic, can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power

sorcerers are rare in the world and most are involved in adventuring in some way
power that seethes in the veins doesn't like to stay quiet
sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, with a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on
often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure
some seek a greater understanding of the magic that infuses them, or to answer the mystery of its origin
others hope to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential
# Sorcerous Origins
## Draconic Bloodline
draconic magic that was mingled with their blood or that of their ancestors
trace their descent to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a [[dragon]] or who had a dragon parent
some bloodlines are well established, but most are obscure
any sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance
## Wild Magic
innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation
might have been exposed to some form of raw magic, perhaps Limbo
maybe blessed by a powerful [[fey]] creature or marked by a demon
could be a fluke of birth with no apparent cause or reason
the chaotic magic churns within, waiting for any outlet
