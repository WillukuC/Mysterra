# Description
paladins swear to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with good things of the world against the darkness, to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk
different paladins focus on the various aspects of the cause, but all are bound by oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work
although they use divine magic, a paladin's power comes from a commitment to justice itself, not from a god
paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor
also wield magical power, used for healing the sick and injured, smiting the wicked and undead, protecting the innocent who join them in the fight for justice

barring a lasting injury that prevents adventuring, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil
fighters are rare enough among the ranks of militias and armies, paldins even rarer
their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, second to the crown or country or other entity which they serve
a delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure
evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion
# Sacred Oaths
## Oath of Devotion
binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, order
sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, holy warriors
meet the ideal of a knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good
hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct and some hold the rest of the world to the same standards
many who swear this oath are devoted to law and good
they hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms
### Tenets of Devotion
***Honesty.*** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. 
***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.
***Honor.*** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.
***Duty.*** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have authority over you.
## Oath of the Ancients
is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of druids
sometimes called fey knights, green knights, horned knights
these paladins cast their lot with the side of light in the cosmic struggle because they love the beautiful and life-giving things in the world
they adorn their armor with images of growing things (leaves, antlers, flowers) to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world
### Tenets of the Ancients
***Kindle the Light.*** Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.
***Shelter the Light.*** Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.
***Preserve your own Light.*** Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
***Be the Light.*** Be a glorious beacon for all who live in
despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth
in all your deeds.
## Oath of Vengeance
A solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin
when evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when a people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too powerful and violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside, paladins swear an oath of Vengeance to right that which has gone wrong
Sometimes called avengers or dark knights
their own purity is not as important as justice
### Tenets of Vengeance
***Fight the Greater Evil.*** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
***No Mercy for the Wicked.*** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
***By Any Means Necessary.*** My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.
***Restitution.*** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.
