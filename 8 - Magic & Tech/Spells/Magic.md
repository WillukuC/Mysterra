All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.
# Sources of Magic
## Weave
Mortals can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.
Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field rearrange the Weave so that magic fiows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways - or not at alI.

# Casting a Spell
Casting a spell does not come for free. Whether a caster uses Mystra's weave, the power of the plane itself, or the power of their deity, they must all use the same basic rules. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, regardless of the source. 
## Components
A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you simply cannot cast the spell.
### Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power, but the particular combination of sounds, with pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motions. 
### Somatic (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
### Material (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects. A component pouch or a spellcasting focus can be used in place of the specified components, unless there is a gold cost indicated for the component. The caster must have a hand free for the spell, but it can be the same hand as for the somatic component.

# Schools of Magic
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
