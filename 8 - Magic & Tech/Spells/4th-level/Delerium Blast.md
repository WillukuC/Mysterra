>**Casting Time**: 1 action
>**Range**: 150 ft.
>**Components**: V, S, M (a delerium fragment worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
>**Duration**: Instant

When you cast this spell, you gain one [level of contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12).<br>
You ignite arcane energies stored inside a delerium fragment held in your hand, and hurl it towards a space you can see within range. It explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere of erratic psychic energy that overwhelms the minds and senses of those within. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes (10d6) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.
##### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 4th.<br>
