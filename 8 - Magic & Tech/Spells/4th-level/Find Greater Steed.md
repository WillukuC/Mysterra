You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a [[Griffon]], a [[Pegasus]], a [[Peryton]], a [[Dire Wolf]], a [[Dragonnel]], a [[Rhinoceros]], or a [[Saber-Toothed Tiger]]. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a [[celestial]], a [[fey]], or a [[fiend]] (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.<br>
You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.<br>
The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.<br>
You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or [[Find Steed|find steed]] at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.<br>
Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.<br>
