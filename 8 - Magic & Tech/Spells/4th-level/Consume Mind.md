>4th-level necromancy
>**Casting Time**: 1 action
>**Range**: Self
>**Components**: V, S, M (a 1-ounce fresh or magically preserved portion of another creature's brain)
>**Duration**: 1 hour

You consume the brain of another creature's corpse, gaining its memories and knowledge. The corpse must have a brain and can't be [[undead]]. The spell fails if the corpse has been dead (and not preserved) for more than three days.<br>
Until the spell ends, you can attempt to recall any important fact known to the creatureâ€”family history, recent events, building layouts, passwords, details of the creature's death, and similar information. To recall a piece of information, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting modifier. The DC is equal to the corpse's Intelligence score.<br>
Once the caster rolls to determine whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall it again.<br>
