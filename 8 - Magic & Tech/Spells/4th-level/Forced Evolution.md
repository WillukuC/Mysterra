By means of this spell, you transform a mutation gained from [contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12). One of the target's existing mutations is removed and is replaced by a different one. This mutation may be chosen by the Game Master or determined randomly (see Appendix C of Dungeons of Drakkenheim).
