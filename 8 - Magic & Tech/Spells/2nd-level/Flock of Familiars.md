You temporarily summon three familiarsâ€”spirits that take animal forms of your choice. Each familiar uses the same rules and options for a familiar conjured by the [[Find Familiar|find familiar]] spell. All the familiars conjured by this spell must be the same type of creature ([[Celestial|celestials]], [[fey]], or [[Fiend|fiends]]; your choice). If you already have a familiar conjured by the [[Find Familiar|find familiar]] spell or similar means, then one fewer familiars are conjured by this spell.<br>
Familiars summoned by this spell can telepathically communicate with you and share their visual or auditory senses while they are within 1 mile of you.<br>
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, one of the familiars conjured by this spell can deliver the spell, as normal. However, you can cast a touch spell through only one familiar per turn.
##### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you conjure an additional familiar for each slot level above 2nd.<br>
