When you cast this spell, you gain one [level of contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12). An arcing bolt of octarine lightning strikes a creature within range. If the target has one or more [contamination levels](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12), it is hit automatically. Otherwise, make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and gains one [level of contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12).<br>
You can create a new bolt of lightning as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
##### At Higher Levels
