You must be in dim light or darkness to cast this spell. You and up to 5 willing creatures you touch are transported along a shadowy path along the border of the [[Prime]] and [[Umbra]]. You move at 50 miles per hour, but cannot discern details or predict the endpoint. 

When the spell ends, you are shunted 1d10Ã—100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you and any creatures with you are shunted to the nearest empty space available. Unwilling creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw, resisting the spell on a successful save.
