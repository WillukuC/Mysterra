Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.<br>
If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as [[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]] or [[Modify Memory|modify memory]]), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.<br>
Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting [[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]] on the strand has the same effect.)<br>
