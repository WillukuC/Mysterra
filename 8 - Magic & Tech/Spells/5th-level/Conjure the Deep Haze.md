When you cast this spell, you gain one [level of contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12).<br>
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of the Deep Haze on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.<br>
When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it suffers (8d6) necrotic damage and gains one [level of contamination](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain any [contamination levels](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12). Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.<br>
