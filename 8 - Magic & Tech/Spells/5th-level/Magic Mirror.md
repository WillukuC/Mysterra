>5th-level abjuration
>**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted by a spell
>**Range**: Self
>**Components**: V, S, M (a polished silver marble)
>**Duration**: Instant

A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 5th level or lower, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain the target of the triggering spell.
