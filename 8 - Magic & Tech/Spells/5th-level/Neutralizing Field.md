You negate contaminated magical energies in a 10-foot radius sphere. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centred on you. Creatures in the sphere (including you) can't gain [contamination levels](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12) and have immunity to necrotic damage. Contaminated spells can't be cast by creatures in the area.
