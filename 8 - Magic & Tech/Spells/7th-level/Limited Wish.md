A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.
- Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower.
- Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.
- Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as [[geas]] or [[insanity]].
- Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or having disadvantage on its next saving throw.
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.
