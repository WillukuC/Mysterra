At your touch, all curses of 3rd level or lower affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded. For each curse of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the curse's level. On a successful check, the curse is removed.
##### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a curse on the target if the curse's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.<br>
