You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself.

The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't affected by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait that some plains have (such as [[Elysium]] and [[Hades]]).

The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane.
