You apply alchemical fluids or holy water to a contaminated [[humanoid]] creature while reciting an exacting magical chant that expels eldritch contaminants from the target's body. When you finish casting the spell, all [contamination levels](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12) and mutations are removed from the creature. It then gains one level of exhaustion for each [contamination level](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#DoDk,12) removed with this spell.<br>
