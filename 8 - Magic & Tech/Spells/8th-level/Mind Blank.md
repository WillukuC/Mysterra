The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils [[limited wish]], [[Miracle]], and [[wish]] spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject’s mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as [[Arcane Eye]], the spell works but the creature simply isn’t detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
