You don’t so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A miracle can do any of the following things.
- Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains).
- Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
- Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as [[Feeblemind]] or [[insanity]].
- Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle gives the cleric one point of exhaustion because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.
- Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
- Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.
- Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment's) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
