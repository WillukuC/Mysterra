In the case of temporary portals, such as those created by the [[gate]] spell, the sextant reveals the temporary nature of that [[gate]]. It does not react to mere dimension extensions such as a [[Bag of Holding]] or a [[Rope Trick]] spell, or to extrusions from other dimensions such as shadow spells.
