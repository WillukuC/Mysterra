When you gain this boon, choose a plane of existence other than the [[Prime|Material Plane]]. You can now use an action to cast the [[plane shift]] spell (no spell slot or components required), targeting yourself only, and travel to the chosen plane, or from that plane back to the [[Prime|Material Plane]]. Once you use this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.
