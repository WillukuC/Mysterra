The curse of zoothropy is a dangerous one. Passed either through the bite of a cursed creature or by birth, zoothropy can be seen as either a blessing or a curse. The original source of zoothropy is unknown; possibly a magical beast was the first to pass it on to a [[humanoid]], or it may have been a curse bestowed by a powerful being or deity.
Zoothropes tend to have three forms: their true form, which is the form they had before they contracted lycanthropy; their beast form, which is the beastly form of their particular curse; and their hybrid form, which is a monstrous amalgamation of their true and beast forms.
## Cure to Zoothropy
Many creatures afflicted with zoothropy may seek a way to end what they call a curse. Zoothropy acquired via an injury can be dispelled by the [[remove curse]] spell, though a zoothrope who inherits the condition from their family can only be cured by a [[wish]].
A [[Zoothropy Antidote]] may also be used to cure one's disease, although they are much harder to come by. The blood of a [[Fzeg]], silver, wolfsbane and other reagents worth a total of 50 gp can be used to concoct the antidote, which takes 4 hours of work and a successful DC 15 INT (Religion) check.
## Types of Zoothropy
It is speculated that there are as many types of zoothropy as there are [[Beast]] on [[Mysterra]], but it is evident that some types are more common than others.
### Common Zoothropy
#### Arcanthropy
[[Werebear]]
#### Aroranthropy
[[Wererat]]
#### Kapranthropy
Those afflicted with Kapranthropy become a [[Wereboar]]. 
###### All Forms
**Damage Immunities** - The wereboar is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered.
**Shapechanger** - The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into its hybrid form, its beast form, or back into its true form.
**Relentless** - When it takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it drops to 1 hit point instead. It can't use this feature again until it finishes a long rest.
###### Hybrid Form and Beast Form
**Stronger** - The wereboar's STR stat is set to 17 if it is not already higher.
**Charge** - If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
**Tusks** - _Melee Weapon Attack:_ PB + STR mod to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 2d6 + STR mod slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + PB + CON mod) or be cursed with wereboar lycanthropy.
###### Beast Form
**Bestial** - The wereboar is unable to speak or use items in this form.
**Faster** - The wereboar's speed becmoes 40 ft.
**Unarmored Defense** - The wereboar's AC becomes 11 + DEX mod.
#### Lycanthropy
[[Werewolf]]
##### Loup Garou Lycanthropy
A Humanoid who succumbs to a [[Loup Garou]]'s lycanthropy becomes a [[Werewolf]]. This form of lycanthropy can't be removed while the loup garou that inflicted the curse lives.
Once a loup garou is slain, a [[remove curse]] spell cast during the night of a full moon on any afflicted werewolf it created forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse is broken, and the target returns to its normal form and gains 3 levels of exhaustion. On a failure, the curse remains, and the target automatically fails any saving throw made to break this curse for 1 month.
#### Tigranthropy
[[Weretiger]]

#### Jaguanthropy
[[Werejaguar]]
#### Koranthropy
[[Wereraven]]
#### Nychtanthropy
[[Werebat]]
#### Ornianthropy
