>Wondrous item, legendary

You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck. If you do so, there is a 1d6 chance that the deck will vanish. It will then reappear 2d6 days later, 100 miles from the point at which it was last found. Each card drawn vanishes as it invokes its power and returns to the deck.

The only truly reliable legend that has managed to survive about the deck is an old song written 400 years ago. This verse exists only as a carving on the wall of a forgotten king's tomb. Few have seen this macabre script, and fewer still believe its tale.

##### The Cards of Matter
| Card       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Dragon | The drawer gains some ability normally associated with a [[dragon]]. Simultaneously, the nearest dragon is robbed of this power. The dragon is instantly aware of what is happening and will attempt to destroy the drawer so that its stolen power can be recovered. The DM should roll on [[Deck of Spheres#The Dragon Card Chart\|the Dragon Power chart]] below to determine the nature of the ability gained. |
| The Gem    | Within the next 24 hours, the character will come across a single gem with a gold piece value equal to the number of experience points that they had at the instant he drew the card. This gem will be utterly flawless and is liable to attract a great deal of attention if sold or displayed                                                                                                                |
| The Forest | The person drawing this card gains the ability to polymorph into a forest creature. At the same time, the drawer is teleported to a region of forest. If the drawer leaves that area for more than one week they will die. Exactly one year after his transformation, the drawer assumes his animal form and cannot become human again.                                                                        |
| The Giant  | The drawer's Str score is boosted to 19 for one year. Following that, it drops to 3 for one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The Sword  | The nearest sword becomes enchanted. The DM rolls a 1d4 to determine the weapon's bonus. If there are no swords within 30 ft., the nearest weapon becomes cursed. The DM rolls a 1d4 to determine the weapon's penalty.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The Treant | The drawer's skin hardens into a thick bark. This reduces his Cha and Dex to a maximum of 6, but gives him a based AC of 18.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| The Arena     | A number of monsters swiftly materialize nearby and attack the character. These are randomly determined, stopping after reaching a total Hit Die value equal to the level of the character. If the hero defeats them alone, they receive enough experience to advance 1 level. |
| The Enemy     | The card summons forth a powerful extraplanar creature of the DM's choice. This monster knows who has drawn the card and that it can only return home by destroying that person.                                                                                               |

| The Sun       | All of the drawer's ability scores are boosted to 19 for 24 hours. At the end of that time, their body bursts into flames and is consumed.                                                                                                                                     |

| The Moon      | The character drawing this card instantly gains 2 points of Dex. At the next full moon, however, he discovers that he has become a lycanthrope. The exact nature of the transformation should be decided by the DM based upon the alignment of the character. |
