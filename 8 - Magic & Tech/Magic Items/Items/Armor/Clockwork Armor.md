The outside surface and internal joints of this armor whir with interlocking gears, drawing on the orderly magic of the plane of [[Mechanus]].

The armor has 4 charges. If you make a d20 roll while wearing this armor, you can expend 1 charge to change the number rolled to a 10. The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
