Ammunition fired from this bow blazes brightly. When you hit with an attack roll using this bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. If the target is a flammable, nonmagical object, it catches fire, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of your turns until a creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.
