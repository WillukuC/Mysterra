# The Departed
Upon the death of a person in [[Mysterra]], the body and the soul are separated. The soul is the lifeforce of a mortal, which is given many names in different cultures, usually "spirit," although [[Dragons]] refer to their lifeforce as "anima."<br>
A spirit automatically begins its journey to the [[Fugue|Fugue Plane]], where it will receive judgment. This process can take anywhere from three days to one month on [[Prime]], although the process seems instantaneous to the soul itself.<br>
The departing soul is known as a hama, and takes the spectral form of an animal, typically a bird. The hama can reach the Fugue Plane from the Prime via several paths, most notably through [[Ether]], [[Astra]] or [[Umbra]]. 
## Hamas, Souls of the Dead
A hama could manifest itself as any kind of bird, reflecting the personality and morality of the soul in life. Eagles and owls are the most common, but falcons, nightingales, parrots, peacocks, sparrows and vultures have also been documented.<br>
Wicked souls appeared as birds that struggled to fly: birds with clipped wings, poor fliers such as roosters or parrots, and even flightless birds such as emus or penguins.<br>
Though they are like ghosts in some aspects, they are not [[Undead]] (with no link to the [[Mors]]) and thus cannot be turned by clerics.<br>
The soul of a person who was killed violently or who had an essential task to complete could remain bound to the Prime, with the aim to set things right before they move on to the Fugue. Hamas are focused entirely on completing whatever task bound them to the world, which could be as simple as getting revenge on their killer or as complex as the retrieval of an inheritance or estate. The possibilities were many, but usually tied to a certain person or place.<br>
Hamas will only interact with people and creatures directly related to their tasks, or those who could help them. Certain priests immediately recognize hamas for what they are and could aid it with advice or spellcasting. To someone who'd helped complete a task, they might give a gift or serve as messenger, scout, lookout, or some other aid. Even after their task was complete, they typically linger for several days to repay their debt or fulfill their own obligations. 
## Lost Souls
Some souls, for a variety of reasons, never make it to the Fugue Plane. Some become trapped in the Border Ethereal, or in the Shadow as ghosts, visible on the Prime if the spirit so chose.<br>
A number of extreme factors can also prevent a soul from travelling safely to the Fugue. A small percentage of people having suffered an exceptionally violent murder might turn into a revenant, which cannot reach the Fugue until it avenges itself or a certain time limit has passed.<br>
Various magical items might also be used to trap a soul, such as a *ghost lantern* or the greatsword *Chalsembyr's Heart*.
## Types of Mortal Souls
### Petitioners
### Faithless
Souls who had never chosen to follow a patron deity or who never believed in the gods at all would never have a representative sent to retrieve them. Instead, it was mandated that they would enter the City of Judgment and be judged by the god of the dead.  
### False
Souls who had failed to serve their patrons or who had betrayed them were also judged by the god of the dead, who assigned them a task in the City of Judgment for the rest of their existence. The most wicked and unfaithful among the false were actively punished, such as being transformed into larva. The false made up the majority of the City of Judgment's population.
# The Fugue Plane
Upon a soul's arrival to the Fugue, it resided in waiting, wandering about aimlessly, unaware that it had even died, until retrieved by a representative of one of the powers. When this happened, usually after about one to ten days, the soul would always recognize the representative and would accompany the being to its final plane of existence to live out the rest of eternity.<br>
If a soul had not been faithful, a representative might not arrive for centuries. Some souls were said to even fade out if a representative were never to arrive. Others were eventually judged by the lord of the dead, Kelemvor.
## Fiendish Influences
[[Fiends]] from the [[The Lower Planes|Lower Planes]] often came to the Fugue Plane in order to acquire more lowly souls for their respective planes.<br>
[[Devils]], specifically baatezu, get one chance to bargain with a soul in order to reject their patron in exchange for special benefits in [[the Nine Hells]]. Their real objective was to create lemures, a form of devil from which more powerful kinds developed. Most souls refused, but particularly evil souls would take this chance to skip a few steps or to avoid punishment.<br>
[[Demons]], specifically tanar'ri, would descend upon the Fugue in periodic raids, preferring force over discussion in order to steal souls to create manes in [[the Abyss]].
## Divine Influence
There have been several gods of the dead in the Fugue, notably Jergal, Myrkul, [[Cyric]] and now Kelemvor who have held sway in the transitory plane. These gods were typically worshiped by human followers, but other races had their own deities of the dead, who had their own special role in guiding spirits from life to death.<br>
All dead halflings must pass through the realm of Urogalan, elves are escorted by [[Naralis Analor]], and dragons are shepherded by [[Null]] to their final destination.
