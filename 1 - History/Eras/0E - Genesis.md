Before the beginning, there was [[- Absolute Nothingness -|Absolutely Nothing]], a sea of empty space, devoid of anything and everything.<br>
From the Nothingness came a sudden something, a spark. The spark was not known by any name, but it would later come to be known as the [[The All-Maker|All-Maker]].<br>
The All-Maker roamed the Nothingness, observing its surroundings. There had never been something before, but now it was and would continue to be.<br>
It ambled for an instant or for an eternity, and then it created the [[- The Multiverse -|multiverse]].<br>
The multiverse, at first, was empty and devoid of matter or life, and yet it was distinct from Nothing; it was something.<br>
The All-Maker began creating the [[- Planes -|planes]] which would make up the multiverse. The first plane, the [[Plane of Air]], was the easiest to create, for Air is the closest to Nothing.<br>
Air took many forms. Infinite skies of blue, gray and pink; calm clouds of white and tempestuous clouds of gray; calm breezes and raging storms.<br>
The second plane, the [[Plane of Water]], was an infinite ocean with no bottom nor top, no shores upon which waves can crest.<br>
Water, like Air, took many forms as well. Clear Waters of blue, tropical Waters of emerald green, and pitch black Waters at the very depths, where the light could not reach.<br>
Opposite of Water was the third plane: the [[Plane of Fire]], heat given form. Much like Water, the Fire too extended to the infinities.<br>
Fire took the many forms of lulling flames, and raging infernos; the flames ranged from red to orange to yellow to white, each lick of flame in its own frenzy.<br>
The fourth plane, the [[Plane of Earth]], was created opposite of Air. It was a solid and rigid plane, unlike the others, though it was not still.<br>
Extending forever were the brown dirt of the Earth; the cold grey stones, the warm yellow sands and crystals of various hues formed by the immeasurable pressure.<br>
These four planes - Air, Water, Fire and Earth - would come to be known as the [[- Elemental Planes -|Elemental Planes]].<br>
The All observed its creations for another eternal moment, and began to form two new planes. These were the two [[- Energetic Planes -|Planes of Energy]], which would shape the life of the multiverse.<br>
The first was the [[Plane of Positive Energy]], which made up the forces of life energy and healing. The second was the [[Plane of Negative Energy]], which made up the forces of death energy and decay.<br>
As the All toiled on the Energetic Planes, the four Elemental Planes began to shift and morph into new forms, unprompted and unaided by their creator.<br>
The border of the Air and the Water began to freeze, forming a large wall of ice that would become the [[Plane of Ice]].<br>
The Water also softened the Earth, causing it to become muddy and amorphous, no longer as rigid as it was. This became the [[Plane of Ooze]].<br>
The Earth was softened on the other end of itself, though this time by the Fire. It melted with the heat, becoming a rolling sea that became the [[Plane of Magma]].<br>
In between the Fire burned the Air with such intensity that it became black and sooty, polluting the itself such that it became the [[Plane of Smoke]].<br>
These four planes were to be known as the [[- Para-Elemental Planes -|Para-Elemental Planes]], secondary planes at the borders of the Elemental Planes.<br>
They did not stop at mixing amongst themselves, however. They also began to merge and change shape with the newly formed Energetic Planes.<br>
The Positivity aided in the creation of the [[Plane of Lightning]], [[Plane of Steam]], [[Plane of Radiance]] and [[Plane of Minerals]], while the Negativity contributed to the [[Plane of Vacuum]], [[Plane of Salt]], [[Plane of Ash]] and [[Plane of Dust]].<br>
These eight planes were to be known as the [[- Quasi-Elemental Planes -|Quasi-Elemental Planes]], tertiary planes between the Elemental and Energetic.<br>
On the outer edges of the Elemental, a chaotic plane formed in which the elements leaked and lurched, known as the [[Elemental Chaos]]. There was neither shape nor form to the Chaos, and it surrounded the other planes.<br>
These planes later came to be called the [[- Inner Planes -|Inner Planes]], although for now they were not known by any names at all. <br>
On the inner edges of the Elemental, something different happened: the [[- The First World -|First World]] was borne from the Elemental Planes, which acted as its building blocks.<br>
They came together to form [[- Crystal Spheres -|Crystal Spheres]] separated by the [[Phlogiston]]. Each Sphere contained worlds of its own, which were in turn separated by [[Wildspace]]. <br>
The All saw the changing and transforming that the planes were undergoing and created a final plane to bind the Inner Planes together, preventing any more shifting. This plane was the [[Ethereal]], a metaphysical plane that allowed passage from plane to plane.<br>
With the newfound relative stillness of the Planes, the All-Maker observed them once more for another eternal instant.
