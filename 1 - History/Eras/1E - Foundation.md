Once the [[The All-Maker|All-Maker]] was finished with the creation of the multiverse, It observed the vast expansion of universes before It. Then It began to create the creatures that would populate the multiverse.
<br>The [[Primordials]] were created first, which populated the Elemental Planes. They were creatures of their respective elements, shaped by their surroundings and which, in turn, shaped their surroundings.
<br>The most powerful of the Primordials, the Archomentals, 
<br>The [[Behemoths]] were created second, populating the First World. They were massive creatures which could walk, swim, or fly. They were the precursor to the modern [[Beasts]].
<br>The [[Titans]] were created next. They were colossal ancestors to the [[Giants]]. The Titan-folk populated the First World, and were a proud group.
<br>The final creation, the [[Dragons]], were a formidable group of large winged beasts. Their breath could raze forests, their strength could topple mountains, their might was unmatched.
<br>The creating was finished. The All would continue to observe his creations as they interacted amongst themselves, never interfering.
<br>One final Plane emerged from the depths of the multiverse, although it did not do so with input from the All-Maker. This plane was the [[Far Realms|Far Realm]], a distant and alien plane that did not follow the rules of the other planes.
<br>Unnoticed by even the All-Maker, the Far Realm birthed the [[Aberrations]], abominable creatures which did not look or act like the creatures of the other planes.
<br>For a time, the Far Realm kept to itself, and it did so for what seemed to be an eternity.
