## Azrael, Jethro's Guide
An angel who acts as a medium between Jethrolomeu and Kelemvor. He is very direct in his messages to me and is devoted to Kelemvor in all his ways. He swears vengeance on anyone who tries to control or avoid death. In reality, however, Azrael is a phony figure concealing the messenger of a sinister god, attempting to gain influence over the stronghold of Lathander worship present across Mysterra. Secretly, he is tasked with driving Jethrolomeu closer and closer to an evil worship of death while rallying others to his cause. His presence and aura may be the reason for the dark moon that corrupted Jethrolomeu’s celestial blood on the night of his birth, but the young cleric is completely oblivious to that possibility.
## Vecna, the Chained God
## The Goodfellow Family
### Uther Goodfellow
### Guinevere Goodfellow
Mother of Jethrolomeu. She is a high priestess and member of council for matters of urgent decision in the church of Lathander for the region. She is the direct descendant of Uther and so it is from her that the name Goodfellow was given to Jethrolomeu and his siblings. She was very overbearing and protective of Jethrolomeu in his infancy due to him being her 6th child, and often brought him along for her priestly duties so he could get a sense for what she hoped his life was to become. She was the most disappointed when he revealed his desire to leave the church of Lathander and, clinging on to the good that resides within him, still tries to subtly convert him back. She tries to mask her disappointment with understanding of his choices, but he can tell.
### Arthur Goodfellow
Father of Jethrolomeu. Born Whitephantom, he quickly became a member of the Order of the Rising Sun, a group of paladins devoted to Lathander, I'm his youth. Throughout his life, he has been taken part in several operations, and he mostly specializes in charity work and aid to people suffering from dark creatures. He married Guinevere 35 years ago. His operations, combined with Guinevere's tendency to take Jethrolomeu with her on her duties, meant that Jethrolomeu did not see him very often throughout his upbringing. Arthur is a lot more outspoken than his wife, so when he learned of Jethrolomeu's newfound faith, he made several efforts to speak with his son about the decision to worship death, trying to convince him that he's making a mistake. Through these conversations, he did not manage to dissuade his son, but was convinced instead that his son still has good intentions, despite his worship of something like death. His acceptance of his son's ways is far stronger than his wife's, though he still stands by his wife's feelings.
### [[Percival Goodfellow]]
Eldest sibling and brother of Jethrolomeu. He is 35 years old and a member of the Order of the Rising Sun. Specifically, he is in the division of the Order that monitors and guards entrances to the Underdark that are flagged to be of high activity for dark creatures. He is known as Pure-Hearted Percival because, in his earlier years as part of the order, he resisted the temptation of a group of succubi and incubi, subsequently leading the effort to push them back from whence they came. His view of good and evil is very black and white, partially due to his direct experience fighting evils, and so he felt quite betrayed by Jethrolomeu's defection due to an association between death and evil.
### Galahad Goodfellow
Second eldest sibling and brother to Jethrolomeu. He is 33 years old and is also a member of the Order of the Rising Sun, being a member of a patrol that ensures that there is no evil activity in the lands surrounding Uthous. During one incident, a banshee put him to sleep while he was patrolling and angels of Lathander appeared before him to drive away the banshee with their radiance. They then led his horse back to Uthous, disappearing afterwards in a blinding light which awoke him. Because of this occurrence, people have begun calling him the Guided-Light of Lathander. Galahad was even more distraught at Jethrolomeu’s calling to worship death, as he had been very protective of the boy when he was young.
### Gawain Goodfellow
Middle sibling and eldest sister of Jethrolomeu. She may not be the oldest, at 30, but she is the most renowned of the currently living mainline Goodfellows, as she holds a commanding position within the Order of the Rising Sun. Moreover, a few years ago, on the orders of her mother, she organized an effort to drive the dark creatures in the area further underground, so that fewer of them could haunt the surface. Though quite large in its scope, the operation was a resounding success, with limited casualties and a dramatic decrease in sightings of dark creatures around Uthous, none were prouder of her than her parents. At the time, comparisons were even drawn between her and her ancestor, Uther and, so given the significance associated to Jethrolomeu’s birth, there weren’t many better candidates for people to mentor him once he was grown enough to enter the Order. For all her great feats and prestige, though, she was never one to speak much, often keeping to herself. She seemed to like the glory that she had garnered, and could sometimes be heard speaking to others about them, but beyond that, she is somewhat of a mystery to her peers. In this vein, she never said much about what she thought about Jethrolomeu, beyond echoing what everyone else already thought, nor did she say much when he abandoned his clerical training in the Morning Lord’s church.
### Bedivere Goodfellow
Sister to Jethrolomeu. Bedivere is different from the rest of her siblings in a number of ways. 28 years old, she is most noticeably not a member of the Order of the Rising Sun, like her older siblings, nor is she a priestess of Lathander in Uthriel like her mother. That is not to say that she is not an active member of the faith; she is among the most fervently devoted to the Morning Lord, but she chooses to express it in different ways. Instead of being part of an organized church or order, she wished to be directly among the people, doing the good work for them. Though she began in priestly studies, she found it not suitable to her, and, at the age of 20, she set off to travel the lands and help all those in need. Her parents were supportive, as long as she promised to visit every now and then. Off she went, free from Uthous, and the terrifying fear of the dark creatures, she began helping the needy in every small way she could. In his youth, Jethrolomeu looked up to her a lot, far more than his other siblings. He could also tell that the life of strict devotion he was being prepared for was not for him, but he didn’t want to shatter the dreams of his parents.
### Galehaut Goodfellow
Youngest brother of Jethrolomeu (Deceased). Galehaut was the only sibling that was even close to Jethrolomeu’s age, as he would have been 20 if he was still alive. The two of them were very close growing up, and spent a lot of time trying to unwind by goofing off or playing pranks, rebelling against the strict priestly lives they were being prepared for. Jethrolomeu almost felt comfortable enough to tell him that he did not want to worship the light at all, but before that could happen, tragedy struck. Jethrolomeu is still not sure exactly what happened, But, a few years ago, Galehaut was killed in a hunting accident. Galehaut loved to hunt, and would often take Jethrolomeu along with him. On this particular occasion, though Jethrolomeu was sick, and before the sun set that day, news of Galehaut’s accidental death was delivered. Thrown into a depression, Jethrolomeu’s interest in death sparked into a flame and, he searched for ways to bring his brother back. Thankfully, though, Kelemvor’s graceful hand found him and comforted him. Over time, he came to understand death more, and began to hope that he could help others to see beyond it. With this new found purpose, he was able to get back up like he never had before, to his family’s confusion and dismay. What still sometimes bothers Jethrolomeu to this day, though, is that he still doesn’t know how his brother died, nor why his body was so horribly mutilated upon discovery.
### [[Tristan Goodfellow]]
Second Cousin. Somewhere back in the family history, a branch of the Goodfellow family became merchants, who traveled the lands selling goods. One such family member is Tristan, who Jethrolomeu has only met a few times at family gatherings. He sometimes sells little figures and products with the symbol of Lathander on them.
His horses are called Betsy and Horace.
## Mordred, Childhood Friend
Mordred is Jethrolomeu’s best friend, and the only person who has fully accepted his calling to worship death. He is currently studying to become a cleric of Lathander, much like Jethrolomeu was, and still makes time to spend together. In their youth, he, Jethrolomeu and Galehaut would go hunting, and it was Mordred who discovered Galehaut’s body on that fateful day. Mordred is a good friend, though he does not always know how to best support Jethrolomeu; he tries his best. Jeth can be a hard book to read sometimes, though.
