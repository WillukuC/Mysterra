## The Four Horsemen
The four heroes, after setting off on their individual journeys, are going to unwittingly stumble upon each other. 
Jethro is travelling in Tristan Goodfellow's caravan along a forest road, when all of a sudden Fern crosses their path, frantic and in a hurry. Before anything can be explained, they are waylaid by a redcap, a fey with an insatiable bloodlust. Xarrias emerges quickly behind it, having been hunting the redcap for a while. Cynthia, running along the road to deliver a letter, also happens upon the situation. (Initiative: Party vs the [[Redcap]])
