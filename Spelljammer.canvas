The ship was boarded by pirates, who defeated the crew and threw everyone into the brig. Sometime after their defeat, an Astral Dreadnought attacks the ship, killing everyone on board, and leaving those in the brig to die. Long after the death of his crewmates, J3D powers down. Years later, J3D awakens in the brig of the ship to skeletons, as well as the Shifter-Sun Elf duo who awaken him."},
