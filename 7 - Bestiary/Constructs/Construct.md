## Description
Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of [[Mechanus]], such as [[Modron|modrons]], are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.
