Modrons were a race of immortals known for their zealous adherence to the principles of law and order above all else. Just as [[Fiend]] were considered the embodiment of evil and [[Celestial]] the embodiment of good, so were modrons the embodiment of the universal principle of order.
## Description
A modron's appearance was varied and depended on their position in modron society. The most common appearance of a modron was as a geometric shape, such as a sphere or cube. The amount of sides as well as structure determined a modron's position in their society. The more sides a modron had, or the more complex their structure was, the higher they were ranked. The highest ranked modrons were humanoid in appearance.
## Combat
Modron armies battled the forces of chaos and entropy across the multiverse. They used logic in developing their tactics and followed proven battle strategies. They were relentless in battle, fighting without compassion or remorse, and were willing to sacrifice themselves to achieve their objective.
## Abilities
All modrons were immune to mind-affecting, emotion-affecting, and magic that drew upon the Positive Energy or the Negative Energy plane. They were resistant to cold, fire, and acid. Hierarch modrons had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience, clairvoyance, command, [[Dimension Door]], teleport without error, and wall of force spells at will.
## Society
Modron culture was simple. Each modron obeyed all commands given to it by any modron one rank higher. These commands were obeyed without question. Modrons were only aware of modrons one rank higher than they were, for example, a quadrone could issue orders to tridrones, duodrones, and monodrones, but would only obey orders from pentadrones. If a modron higher in rank than a pentadrone issued an order to a quadrone, it would view it as some exceptionally powerful pentadrone. All modrons were aware of the existence of Primus, however. Modrons were unwavering in their devotion to order, departing [[Mechanus]] to complete strange tasks in the name of law. The modrons served [[Primus]], godlike ruler of Mechanus.
There were fourteen castes of modrons, divided in two major categories:
