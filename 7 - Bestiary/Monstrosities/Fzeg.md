### Passives
#### Shapechanger
The fzeg can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium [[humanoid]] or back into its true form, that of a wolfhumanoid hybrid. It can transform its body parts as part of attacking with them and can choose whether the change remains after making the attack. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it's wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
#### Keen Hearing and Smell
The fzeg has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
#### Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If the fzeg fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
#### Rampage
When the fzeg reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the fzeg can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.
#### Regeneration
The fzeg regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the fzeg takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the fzeg's next turn.
#### Spider Climb
The fzeg can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The fzeg uses its howl, then attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.
#### Bite
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. A humanoid slain after being bitten rises the following night as a fzeglaich under the fzeg's control.
#### Claws
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
#### Howl
Each creature of the fzeg's choice that is within 300 feet of the fzeg and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the fzeg's Howl for the next 24 hours or until it is stunned by the fzeg.
#### Night Children (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
The fzeg magically calls eight wolves. These wolves arrive in 2 rounds, acting as allies of the fzeg and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the fzeg dies, or until the fzeg dismisses them as a bonus action.
