## Appearance
Awakened plants gifted with the powers of intelligence and mobility, blights plague lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.
## Abilities
Twig blights generally fight by raking opponents with treelike claws.

Needle blights possess blindsight only, and can understand common but do not speak. As plants, they lack eyes and a mouth. They are, however, capable of flinging the needles from their bodies as short-ranged projectiles.
When a needle blight detects a potential threat, it releases a particular pollen into the air. This pollen carries to other needle blights who, alerted to the location of the threat, will swarm in from all sides.

Vine blights are slow to move, but as long as they remain motionless they are indistinguishable from a mere tangle of vines. They cannot see, though they have blindsight. Vine blights also possess the ability to call vines and roots to burst out of the ground around them, entangling enemies in the area and hampering their movement.

Astral blights possess blindsight, are able to illuminate a small area around them, and have vines that are able to drain heat from the surrounding area.

Tree blights have no real magical abilities beyond their blindsight, the only way they have to sense the world around them. They are recorded as understanding both the Common and Druidic languages, but are not known to speak.
By remaining still, a tree blight looks like nothing more than a dead tree. They are large enough to be a significant threat to objects and structures.
## Behavior
Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree's control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor's old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.
## Ecology
Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or power, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.

In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.
## Lore
Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire's evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.

_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the blight can't constrict another target.
##### Entangling Plants (Recharge 5â€“6)
Grasping roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for nonplant creatures. In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.

##### Heat-Draining Vine
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

The blight makes two Claw attacks.

_Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
##### Life-Draining Vines (Recharge 6)
Snaking vines erupt from the blight. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) slashing damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If at least one of the creatures that failed this save isn't a [[Construct]] or an [[Undead]], the blight regains 9 hit points.
