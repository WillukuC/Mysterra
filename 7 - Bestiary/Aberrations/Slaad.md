## Description

| **Size**        | Tiny (Tadpole)<br>Medium (Gray, Death)<br>Large (Red, Blue, Green) |
| **Alignment**   | Chaotic neutral                                                    |
| **Environment** | [[Limbo]]                                                              |
The foremost inhabitants of the inhospitable plane of the Ever-Changing Chaos of [[Limbo]] are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.
## Appearance

## Abilities
Some slaadi can transform into the [[humanoid]] creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the [[Prime]] to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.

Green slaadi are surprisingly intelligent and possess innate spellcasting ability. A green slaad can change its shape to appear as a humanoid. If it was born of a humanoid host, the slaad usually adopts its host's form.
## Behavior
As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child's fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad.

Outside of Limbo, gray slaadi act as living extensions of the will of their masters, the death slaadi. A gray slaad journeys to the [[Prime]] on errands of doom, often taking humanoid form. A gray slaad learns how to master the use of a greatsword and imbue it with its own innate magic.
## Habitat

## Ecology
Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.

When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host's body, feeds on the host's remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad-or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher-within 2d12 hours.

The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them. This infection, called chaos phage, transforms its victim into a fully grown red slaad—or green slaad if the host was a spellcaster able to cast 3rd level spells or higher.

At some unpredictable point in its existence, a green slaad unlocks the means to magically, instantly, and permanently transform itself into a gray slaad. Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades.

A gray slaad that eats the entire corpse of a dead death slaad instantly transforms into a death slaad.
## Lore
Long ago, [[Primus]], overlord of the [[Modron|modrons]], created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in [[Limbo]], believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.

The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.

### Passives
#### Magic Resistance
The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
#### Regeneration
The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
#### Bite
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.
#### Claw
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a minuscule slaad egg.
A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.
If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated.

_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
#### Claw
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.
