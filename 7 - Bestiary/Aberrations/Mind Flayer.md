### Passives

>[!info] Spells
>*At will:* [[detect thoughts]], [[Levitate|levitate]]
>*1/day each:* [[dominate monster]], [[plane shift]] (self only)
#### Magic Resistance
The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
### Actions
#### Tentacles
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
_Hit:_ 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.
#### Extract Brain
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated [[humanoid]] grappled by the mind flayer. 
_Hit:_ The target takes 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.
#### Mind Blast (Recharge 5â€“6)
The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
