### Passives
#### Magic Resistance
The fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
#### Death Throes (Demon Only)
When the fiend drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the fiend explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d10 + the spell's level fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Devil's Sight (Devil Only)
Magical darkness doesn't impede the fiend's darkvision.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The fiend makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).
#### Bite (Demon Only)
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 1d12 + 3 + the spell's level necrotic damage.
#### Claws (Yugoloth Only)
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 1d8 + 3 + the spell's level slashing damage. Immediately after the attack hits or misses, the fiend can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
#### Hurl Flame (Devil Only)
_Ranged Spell Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, range 150 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 2d6 + 3 + the spell's level fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
