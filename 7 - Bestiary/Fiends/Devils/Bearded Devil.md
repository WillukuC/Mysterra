### Passives
#### Barbed Hide
At the start of each of its turns, the barbed devil deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.
#### Devil's Sight
Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.
#### Magic Resistance
The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The devil makes three melee attacks: one with its tail and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use Hurl Flame twice.
#### Claw
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
#### Tail
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
#### Hurl Flame
_Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
#### Summon Devil (1/Day)
The devil chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.
A barbed devil has a 30 percent chance of summoning one barbed devil.
A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
