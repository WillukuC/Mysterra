## Description
| **Type**        | [[Fiend]] ([[Demons\|Demon]]) |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| **Size**        | Huge          |
| **Alignment**   | Chaotic evil  |
| **Environment** | [[The Abyss]]         |
## Appearance
The goristro resembles a fiendish [[minotaur]] towering more than twenty feet tall. Their overall structure is somewhat bear-like, but their arms are long and wide like the trunks of trees. Because of this, they move on their knuckles like giant gorillas as they barrel forward. Great muscularity is clearly visible across their entire squat forms. Necessarily wide shoulders carry a massive head reminiscent of a leering bison, with carnivorous teeth and giant horns that curve upward. Their hands and feet are giant and splayed, yet still humanoid in shape.

A wide variety of color palettes exist among them including dark brown, sickly green and purplish gray. Tame goristroi often have markings indicating their masters, whether they be collars, bands, tattoos or horn carvings. While the maximum size of the building-sized behemoths is unknown, the largest reported goristro was 200 ft.
## Abilities
Goristroi were strange among tanar'ri in that they possessed practically no supernatural abilities associated with their kin. They could not communicate telepathically, although they could still speak, and were incapable of summoning more tanar'ri to their aid. What little magical ability they had let them climb walls, levitate, strike fear into the hearts of those around them and regenerate from minor injury.

Goristroi shared the preternatural navigational skills of minotaurs, never becoming lost and hunting through labyrinthine passages with ease. They were powerful enough to grant this ability to a few others as a magical boon, although like all demonic boons they stayed at the demon's pleasure and accepting them corrupted a soul with chaotic evil and insanity.
## Behavior
When controlled by a demon lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and prized pets. Goristros possess preternatural cunning when navigating labyrinthine passages and shifting corridors, pursuing foes in a terrifying hunt. 

Goristroi are completely lacking in subtlety, and without the supervision of a more intelligent being, were prone to going on rampages in random directions. If left this way, they had little in the way of goals outside of being predators, despite not needing food. They consumed for the simple but cruel fun that came from eating living things, and cared not if something was actually edible. So long as an object was small enough to fit in its mouth and moved, the goristro would not hesitate to eat it: a clear demonstration of their greatest weakness.

A hulking goristro sometimes bears a palanquin, carrying smaller demons on its broad shoulders, much like an elephant carries riders on its back.
## Habitat
Goristros can be found anywhere in the Abyss, but are particularly common in Baphomet's [[600 - Endless Maze|Endless Maze]] or in [[23 - The Iron Wastes|the Iron Wastes]], where they often inhabit the same caverns as the fiendish giants that rule that realm.
## Ecology
Goristroi almost never bred naturally, but instead were mated by their owners after lengthy negotiations with another goristro's master. Both had to be watched closely to avoid trickery by the other side, such as abduction or infanticide. The terms of the agreement normally had the single child be given to whichever side had a goristro of the opposite sex. After 5 years the beast would reach maturity, allowing whichever owner received it to breed his own, albeit inbred, ones. Breaking of the terms of these agreements, even through simply buying the young, were common. It was never allowed for a goristro's parents to have influence on it. Centuries worth of selective breeding within fighting pits only enhanced their already dangerous physique.
## Lore
As one might predict, the goristroi were the creations of [[Baphomet]], made within his Tower of Science, and his most legendary monsters. The Horned Lord allowed glabrezu to capture his favorite beasts, knowing that their prevalence throughout [[the Abyss]] brought him fame and glory. When not being captured they stalked his [[600 - Endless Maze|Endless Maze]] hungrily wandering throughout the halls crushing enemy and ally alike. They were nearly always seen on the Prime due to the activities of one of Baphomets' cultists, summoned due to the need for a guardian.

A goristro named Orwantz under the personal command of [[Graz'zt]] patrolled [[45-47 - Azzagrat|Azzagrat]]'s borders to defend travelling merchants by destroying the few bandits that prowled the area. He demanded tribute from his protectorates, that often found it's way into the Argent Palace's treasure chambers. Orwantz wore a crown of black adamantine with black opals that signified his relation to Graz'zt, and it was rumored the jewelry allowed Graz'zt to temporarily possess him, combining shocking strength with a cunning mind.

The largest known goristro was ten times the size of most and known as Bjornganal. He walked around the Abyss with a small village of araneas living on his back and shoulders.

#### Charge
If the goristro moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 38 (7d10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.
#### Labyrinthine Recall
The goristro can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.
#### Magic Resistance
The goristro has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
#### Siege Monster
The goristro deals double damage to objects and structures.

The goristro heals 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns.
#### Innate Spellcasting
>[!info] Spells

### Actions
#### Multiattack
The goristro makes three attacks: two with its fists and one with its hoof.
#### Fist
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
#### Hoof
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

_Hit:_ 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
#### Stamp (Recharge 5-6)
Up to three times per day, a goristro can produce a shock wave that sends its foes careening off-balance by stamping on the ground as a standard action. The shock wave lasts for 1 round and duplicates the effects of an [[Earthquake]] spell in an 80-foot radius around the goristro. The goristro and others of its kind is unaffected by the earthquake.
### Reactions
#### Raging Frenzy
When the goristro is attacked by an adjacent enemy while under 220 hit points, it makes a frenzied gore attack against the enemy.
