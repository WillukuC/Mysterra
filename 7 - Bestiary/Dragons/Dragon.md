## Description
Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. [[True dragons]], including the good [[metallic dragons]] and the evil [[chromatic dragons]], are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and [[Pseudodragon|pseudodragons]].
