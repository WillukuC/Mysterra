### Passives
#### Shared Resistances
When you summon the dragon, choose one of its damage resistances. You have resistance to the chosen damage type until the spell ends.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The dragon makes a number of Rend attacks equal to half the spell's level (rounded down), and it uses Breath Weapon.
#### Rend
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 1d6 + 4 + the spell's level piercing damage.
#### Breath Weapon
The dragon exhales destructive energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 damage of a type this dragon has resistance to (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
