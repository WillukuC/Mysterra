| **Size**        | Medium                 |
| **Alignment**   | Lawful good            |
| **Environment** | Faerie, forest, plains |
## Appearance
Blink dogs look like ordinary canines with yellow-brown fur and large ears. 
## Abilities
Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in seemingly random fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them to take advantage of flanking.

They can blink in and out of the [[Ether]] at will, as well as teleport once per round as a free action. 
## Behavior
Blink dogs are social animals, often traveling in packs. They eat equal amounts of meat and plant matter.

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines, and growls that can transmit complex information. When not hunting, they are playful with each other but very protective of their pups, which outsiders sometimes steal to train as guard animals. Blink dogs and displacer beasts are natural enemies.

If seriously threatened, the entire pack will blink out and not return.
## Habitat
Blink dogs originate in the [[Faerie]], inhabiting open plains and forests. They avoid human lands, but drive off evil [[Humanoid|humanoids]] that enter their territory.
