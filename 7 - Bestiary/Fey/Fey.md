## Description
Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the [[Faerie]]. Some are also found in the [[Outer Planes]], particularly the planes of [[Arborea]] and [[the Beastlands]]. Fey include [[Dryad|dryads]], [[Pixie|pixies]], and [[Satyr|satyrs]].
## Appearance
Many are typically [[humanoid]] in shape.
## Abilities
Many have supernatural abilities and a connection to nature or to some other force or place.
### Contracts
A fey contract is formed when a creature receives a gift from a Fey and is expected to give the Fey something in return. The gift can be almost anything, and the contract forms as soon as the gift is received. Most fey contracts can be broken with the [[remove curse]] spell, with the exception of those made by powerful fey such as ancient [[hags]], the queens of the Courts, and other powerful archfey. Such contracts require a [[wish]] spell or an elaborate ritual to negate.
Such ways to become bound to a fey contract include:
- Accepting a gift from a Fey
- Stealing something from a Fey
- Taking the life of a creature that made a contract with a Fey
Contracts can be divided into greater and lesser contracts. Greater contracts are made with archfey, ancient hags, and other powerful Fey spellcasters. Lesser contracts are made with Fey of all other sorts.
##### Greater Contract Gifts
- **Audience**. You and your companians gain a private audience with the [[Titania|Summer Queen]], the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], or both.
- **Major Magic Item**. You gain a very rare magic item that is yours to keep, or a legendary magic item for 5d12 days.
- Safety. One creature that previously regarded you as an enemy no longer remembers you at all.
- **Time Displacement**. You and your companions can return to the [[Prime]] up to fifty years from now without having aged a day.
- **Title**. You gain an important title and all the rewards that come with it.
- **Wealth**. You receive up to 50,000 gp worth of coins, jewelry, or property.
##### Lesser Contract Gifts
- **Charm**. You gain a charm of your choice.
- **Fey Kinship**. For 5d6 days, you gain either the Fey Ancestry trait common among [[elves]] or the Speak with Small Animals trait common among forest [[gnomes]].
- **Guide**. You and your companions receive help from a guide who can guarantee safe passage through a particular region of the [[Faerie]].
- **Inspiration**. You gain inspiration each day at dawn for 2d4 days.
- **Invitation**. You receive an invitation to the Summer Court or the [[Faerie Pantheon|Gloaming Court]] (though this does not guarantee audience with their respective Queens).
- **Minor Magic Item**. You gain a common magic item that is yours to keep, or an uncommon magic item for 5d6 days.
- **Proficiency**. You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice for 2d4 days.
- **Spellcasting**. You gain the ability to cast a spell of 4th level or lower once, without material components. You choose the spell, and your spellcasting ability for it is Charisma.
#### Price of a Contract
Fey can expect to receive an assortment of things for a gift they bestow. To collect something intangible, such as a creature's singing voice or the color in its eyes, a Fey must tap into the magic of the Faerie. For this reason, a Fey can't claim such a thing unless they and the creature with which they made the contract are both in the Faerie.

#### Breaking a Contract
The Faerie can punish a creature for breaking a contract, but the creature must be on the plane to be affected. The penalty imposed on a creature who breaks a lesser contract can be removed by any magic that ends a curse; a wih spell is needed for a greater contract.
##### Breaking a Greater Contract
| d8  | Penalty                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | You can't speak or cast spells with verbal components. Whenever you try to speak, you bray like a donkey instead.                                                                                |
| 2-3 | You magically transform into an [[owl]]. You retain your languages, your ability to speak, and your mental ability scores. You otherwise have the statistics of an owl.                              |
| 4-5 | You can't attune to magic items. If you are currently attuned to one or more, your attunement to them ends immediately.                                                                          |
| 6-7 | You are petrified.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 8   | An iron thorn is magically lodged in your chest. Every day, you can feel it move closer to your heart. If this effect is not ended within 3 days, you die and can't be revived within 5d12 days. |
##### Breaking a Lesser Contract
| d8  | Penalty                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-2 | Your appearance becomes more toad-like (warty skin, bulbous eyes, large mouth, and webbed digits). This transformation has no game effects.            |
| 3   | You smell like swamp gas. No amount of bathing can rid you of this stench.                                                                             |
| 4   | Your shadow does not match your movements, which other creatures find unsettling.                                                                      |
| 5-6 | Your appearance becomes more rat-like (beady eyes, whiskers, small ears, pointy nose, little hands and feet). This transformation has no game effects. |
| 7   | You cast no reflection. Superstitious folk who notice think you're a vampire.                                                                          |
| 8   | You are constantly surrounded by a small cloud of annoying but harmless flies.                                                                         |
### Curses
Curses are common punishments among archfey and other powerful Fey creatures. An adventurer might be cursed for any number of reasons, a few of which are listed below:
- Offending a powerful Faerie denizen
- Entering a forbidden place
- Appearing in a fey court without an invitation
##### Fey Curses
| d8  | Curse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Your ears are magically replaced by a pair of soft, fuzzy donkey ears. Moreover, when you try to speak, you instead bray.                                                                                                                                        |
| 2   | You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion. Until the curse ends, these levels of exhaustion can't be removed.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | Spells can't restore hit points to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4   | The sound of pixie laughter fills your head while you are awake, drowning out all other sounds.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5   | Anything you try to pick up or hold in your hands slips through your fingers.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | Moonlight burns your flesh. You take 1d10 radiant damage when you start your turn in moonlight.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7   | You are magically transformed into an animated wooden doll that looks like you. Your statistics are the same, but you are a [[Construct]] with vulnerability to fire damage, and you don't require air, food, or drink. Items worn or carried by you are unaffected. |
| 8   | Whenever you tell a lie, you lose the ability to speak for 1d8 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
A [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic is usually enough to end a Fey curse on a creature, but some Fey curses are tenacious and resistant to all magic except a [[wish]] spell. A creature can also remove such a curse on itself by learning and performing a specific task or ritual.
##### Ending the Curse

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You must carve your name into a tree, whereupon the tree inherits the curse's magic and dies.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2   | You must drink the blood of a pixie or sprite while basking in moonlight.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3   | You must speak the true name of the creature that cursed you three times in a row.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4   | While standing in sunlight on an arched bridge over running water, you must beg the [[Titania                                                                                                     \| Summer Queen]] for her "fair blessing."                                       |
| 5   | After filling your pockets with fool's gold, you must flap your arms and quack like a duck.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6   | You must bury an executioner's hood (a blackcapped mushroom found in the Feywild) in the earth and pour goat's milk over it while whistling.                                                                                                                                       |
| 7   | You must be bitten by a [[faerie dragon]]. (It's possible any [[faerie dragon]] might do, or the [[faerie dragon]] might have to be of a particular color.)                                                                                                                        |
| 8   | You must leave a bouquet of eight black roses at the place where you were cursed, or you must give the bouquet to the creature that cursed you.                                                                                                                                    |
| 9   | You must persuade a [[centaur]] to carry you on its back for eight miles. Before the [[centaur]] will do this willingly, it might demand a gift or service in exchange, or the completion of a quest.                                                                                  |
| 10  | You must obtain leaves or pinecones from three different species of treants and burn them in a campfire under a full moon while singing a particular campfire song.                                                                                                                |
| 11  | You must bake a small cake and leave it on the doorstep of a forest [[Gnomes                                                                                                                      \| gnome]]'s abode. Only when the gnome eats the whole cake does your curse end. |
| 12  | You must persuade another creature to willingly take your name. If it does so, it inherits your curse, whereupon you are nameless and must choose a new name for yourself.                                                                                                         |
## Behavior
The common language of the fey is Sylvan. 

A fey creature rarely ignores the importance of reciprocity, hospitality, and gifts.
### Reciprocity
By and large, Fey feel strongly about quid pro quo and balance. If something is taken, then something must be given, and what a Fey considers to be of equal value is the big question. A Fey might steal a human's beloved pet and leave in its place a brightly painted wooden effigy. This exchange satisfies the agreement of reciprocity, and a Fey who makes it sleeps soundly at night, content that the exchange was fair.
### Hospitality
Hospitality is a pillar of Fey society. Treating a visitor to one's home with courtesy and generosity is important to most Fey, but the visitor must show their host the same courtesy and not act boorishly or demonstrate blatant impropriety. Rudeness breaks the bond of reciprocity and frees a Fey host from the obligation to be hospitable, but each Fey has different ideas about what constitutes rudeness.
### Gifts
Fey are avid gift-givers, and their gifts are usually very thoughtful. Good gifts have sentimental value to the giver. For example, a beloved heirloom makes a fine gift to a Fey creature. A throwaway gift is an insult that flies in the face of reciprocity and hospitality.

Gifts provide a kind of balance that many Fey obsess over. If there is a perceived imbalance, a carefully chosen gift can set things right; this is why refusing a gift from a Fey creature can cause them consternation, as they're trying to right a perceived imbalance by giving the gift. But accepting a gift from a Fey can cause problems for the uninitiated traveler, as it can indebt them to the Fey creature: "I gave you a gift, so now you must give me one in return." It can also lead to the formation of an accidental fey contract.

**Good gifts to give Fey:**
- Family ring
- Talisman sacred to your druid circle
- Favorite hat
- Piece of art that you made
- Trinket from the [[Prime]]
- Favorite dessert recipe
- Sensational, applause-worthy performance
- Haircut or bath

**Bad gifts to give Fey:**
- Item that has outlived its usefulness
- Item you intended to get rid of
- Half-hearted performance
- Cursed, evil or broken item
## Habitat
Fey creatures live in abodes they fashion for themselves or repurpose for their needs. Characters might stumble upon these abodes in their Feywild wanderings.

## Lore
The darkest and most powerful legend about fey went back eons, to the [[creator races]]. Some sages claimed that fey creatures known as the [[LeShay]] were one of the four, possibly five, creator races.
