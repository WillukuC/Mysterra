## Description
| **Type**        | Fey                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Size**        | Medium                  |
| **Alignment**   | Neutral or chaotic good |
| **Environment** | [[Faerie]], forest          |
## Appearance
A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf's, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons.
## Abilities
Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile [[Humanoid|humanoids]] with her enchantments, turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.
## Behavior
Dryads act as guardians of their woodland domains. Shy and reclusive, they watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty of a stranger might investigate more closely, perhaps even try to lure the individual away to be charmed. Dryads work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to druids that share the dryads' devotion to the woods they call home.

Dryads defend trees from any who would fell them, sometimes coming into conflict with humans and others who take wood from the forests.
## Habitat
A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world. As long as the tree remains healthy and unharmed, the dryad stays forever youthful and alluring. If the tree is harmed, she suffers. If the tree is ever destroyed, the dryad descends into madness.
## Lore
Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love is forbidden.

### Passives
#### Innate Spellcasting
The dryad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>[!info] Spells
>*At will:* [[druidcraft]]
>*3/day each:* [[entangle]], [[goodberry]]
>*1/day each:* [[barkskin]], [[pass without trace]], [[shillelagh]]
#### Magic Resistance
The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
#### Speak with Beasts and Plants
The dryad can communicate with [[Beast|beasts]] and [[Plant|plants]] as if they shared a language.
#### Tree Stride
Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be large or bigger.
#### Tree Dependent
Each dryad is mystically bound to  single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 900 ft. from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate magic.
### Actions
#### Club
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.
#### Fey Charm
The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.
Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.
The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.
