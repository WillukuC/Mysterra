No plant, stone, or water way hinders them within their fetid domain and they hold mastery over all natural creatures.                                                                                   |
| 15         | Green hag, fey, darkvision                            | Green hags know much of magic and the natural world, and can mimic the sounds of any animal that lives near their lair. Hags can magically swap their foul spawn with the unborn babes of other races. Children suspected of having been swapped by a hag are called calibans or changelings. |
| 20         | Hurl Through the Earth, Weakness, Illusory Appearance | Green hags can drain an enemy's strength with the slightest touch and possess significant resistance to magic. Although absolutely evil, green hags are very intelligent and might barter or be reasoned with.                                                                                |
| 25         | No weaknesses, No resistances                         | Green hags are the least xenophobic of all hags and might appear in nearly any environment. They frequently infiltrate urban settings using their innate abilities to change shape, speak any language, turn invisible, or create any number of other distractions.                           |
| 30         |                                                       | Green hags operate just as well above water as below. They often foster their children to [[humanoid]] families, but cannot switch children before birth. There is no such thing as a caliban or changeling.                                                                                  |

### Passives
#### Amphibious
The hag can breathe air and water.
#### Innate Spellcasting
The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>[!info] Spells 
>*At will:* [[Dancing Lights|dancing lights]], [[Disguise Self|disguise self]], [[Ghost Sound|ghost sound]], [[Minor Illusion|minor illusion]], [[Pass Without Trace|pass without trace]], [[Ray of Sickness|ray of sickness]], [[Thorn Whip|thorn whip]], [[Tongues|tongues]], [[Vicious Mockery|vicious mockery]], [[Water Breathing|water breathing]]
>*1/day:* [[Spike Growth|spike growth]]
#### Mimicry
The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The hag can take one action of her choice and make one claw attack.
#### Claws
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
#### Hurl Through the Earth
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is teleported 15 ft. away from the hag.
#### Weird Magic (max 2, unless in mortal danger)
The hag has access to strange, single-use items that don't emulate common spells or even follow the normal rules of magic. As they are extremely rare or hard to replace, a hag typically only uses anywhere from one to three per encounter.
- *Mummified Brume Toad:* When thrown into her cauldron, replicates the effects of *[[Fog Cloud|fog cloud]]*, centered on herself.
- *Darkwin's Spinner:* When squished between her fingers, replicates the effects of *[[Web|web]]*, centered in front of her.
- *Ornate Antique Mirror:* When smashed to pieces, replicates the effects of *[[Mirror Image|mirror image]]*.
- *Powdered Auric Poppy:* When thrown into the air, replicates the effects of *[[Sleep|sleep]]*.
- *Cranium Rat Skull:* When crushed, replicates the effects of *[[Mind Spike|mind spike]]*.
#### Weakness
The green hag can weaken a foe by making a special touch attack. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CHA save or take a 2d4 reduction to their Strength stat.
#### Illusory Appearance
The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. 
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 13 INT (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
#### Invisible Passage
The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
### Lair Actions
- The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.
- A stagnant miasma forms a cloud in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the green hag can see within 30 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 CON saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn.
### Regional Effects
The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Birds, rodents, snakes, [[Spider|spiders]], or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.
- [[Beast|Beasts]] that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.
- Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.
A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:
- Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.
- The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
- Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.
