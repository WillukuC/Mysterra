## Appearance
A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but much taller and slightly heavier. A centaur is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 2100 pounds. Brown dominates most of a centaur’s coloring, the long hair on the top of the head and the glossy fur of the horselike body ranging from a light tan to a deep, dark brown. A centaur’s humanlike torso has a swarthy, earthy complexion. In some isolated tribes and rare individuals, other colorings emerge, such as white, gray, or black, but these are extremely uncommon.
## Abilities

## Behavior
Reclusive wanderers and omen-readers of the wild, centaurs avoid conflict but fight fiercely when pressed. They roam the vast wilderness, keeping far from borders, laws, and the company of other creatures. Their normal response to aggression is swift retreat, perhaps after launching a few arrows to discourage pursuit. Against creatures powerful enough to pose danger to the tribe, they appear to use this same tactic, except that half of the "retreating" centaurs will circle around to lie in ambush or attack the foe from the rear.

A centaur that can't keep pace with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe might take up residence among other races. Frontier settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur residents. Many such communities owe their survival to the insight and acumen of a centaur.

Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fishing, agriculture, and trade. Though they shun dealings with humans, they do trade with [[elves]] and with the caravans of other benevolent [[Humanoid|humanoids]] they meet during their wanderings, especially for food and wine. A trader might save the life of a wounded or an elderly centaur unfit for long travel, escorting it to a settlement where it can peacefully live out the rest of its days.

Centaurs have had too many dangerous skirmishes against tribes of vicious gnolls to be anything other than suspicious of the hyena-headed humanoids, but they are open-minded and intelligent enough to get along with an individual gnoll that proves itself trustworthy.

A centaur druid is usually a tribe's designated leader and speaker, but groups of centaur warriors hold great sway in any given tribe, mainly because their choices of where and what to hunt greatly impact how well the tribe will eat in the coming weeks. These hunters, brave and free-spirited as they are, have their passions tempered by the wisdom ofthe centaur druids who study the wilderness through which the tribe roams. Although these groups rarely have lasting conflicts, the hunters and druids often wish to pursue differing short-term goals.

Most centaurs revere a deity named [[Skerrit]], who is a god of nature and community. They love and worship nature, and most who with to devote themselves to a higher power become [[druids]]. Nearly all centaur clerics (who are rare) worship Skerrit.
## Habitat
Centaur tribes range across lands with mild to hot climates, where a centaur requires only light furs or oiled skins to deal with inclement weather. They are hunter-gatherers and rarely build shelters or even use tents.

The typical centaur lair is located deep within a forest. It consists of a large hidden glade and pastures, with a good supply of running water. Depending on the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean-tos to shelter individual families. Hearths for cooking and warmth are in an open area, away from the trees.
## Ecology
Centaur migrations span continents and take decades to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread the same path for generations. These long-ranging patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter settlements of other creatures built along their traditional routes.

Centaurs are skilled horticulturists and may cultivate useful plants near their lair. In dangerous, monster-infested areas they plant thick barriers of thorn bushes around their lair, dig pits, and set snares.

The size of a centaur tribe's territory depends on its population and the nature of the area it inhabits. They do not object to sharing territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur to an intruder depends on the visitor. [[Humans]] and [[dwarves]] are politely asked to leave, [[halflings]] and [[gnomes]] are tolerated, and elves are welcomed. 

Centaurs deal with monsters according to how much of a threat they are to the welfare and survival of the tribe. If a [[Giant|giant]] or [[dragon]] were to enter a tribe's territory, the centaurs would relocate, but they would attempt to kill trolls, orcs and the like.

| 10     | Centaurs are wild folk with a love of battle so powerful that they sell their combat services to other creatures, especially fey. Highly territorial, centaurs brook no trespass and challenge those who enter their lands. Their homes commonly include stretches of awe-inspiring steppes in the [[Faerie]], bordered by rough hills or mountains. Worldly plains, particularly near elven lands, might also support a tribe of centaurs.<br>Centaurs build their villages among hills near water and in natural caves. They do so for protection and a good view of surrounding territory. Peaceful visitors to such settlements do well to loudly announce themselves and bring friendship offerings of food and strong drink, a common centaur custom.                                                                                                                        |

| 16     | Centaurs revere the wild forces represented by [[Kord]] and [[Melora]], rather than those of the fey god [[Corellon Larethian\|Corellon]]. Thus, they love the wild, and they fiercely protect pure lands from despoiling interlopers and monsters. They see combat and athletic contests as paths to renown, and they do not fear death in battle. Their celebrations after successful battles, hunts, or births are unruly and long, full of boasting, sport, and drink.<br>As fierce as they are, centaurs are gentle to one another and to friends. They have a strong mystical tradition and wise leaders, most of which are female. Their laws are simple and very different from human standards. The punishment for serious crimes is banishment from the tribe. Such outlaws must leave the tribe’s lands, and no other tribe member can raise hand or hoof to help them. |

| 21     | Devotion to [[Kord]]’s creed and a spiritual connection to nature is physically manifest in these fey creatures; mystics among the centaurs develop amazing powers over the natural world.
