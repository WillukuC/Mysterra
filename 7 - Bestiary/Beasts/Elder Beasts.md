In the primordial annals of Mysterra's history, the world was dominated by colossal and enigmatic creatures known as Elder Beasts. These magnificent beings were the ancient precursors to the creatures that roam the world today.<br>
They existed long before the rise of the mortal races, and their memory is shrouded in myth, legend, and reverence. The Elder Beasts were titanic in size and held dominion over the skies, the land, and the depths of the sea.

## [[Ababils]]
The Ababils, magnificent Elder Beasts of the sky, are creatures of boundless grace and otherworldly beauty. These ethereal giants once ruled the heavens, casting shadows across the sky as they soared amidst the clouds. Ababils are said to be the progenitors of all winged creatures, from the tiniest songbirds to the mightiest dragons. Their presence in the ancient world left a lasting imprint on the collective imagination, inspiring countless tales of skyward adventures.<br>
Ababils were colossal, feathered beings, with wingspans that could eclipse entire villages. Their plumage shimmered in an array of celestial colors, and their eyes held the secrets of forgotten constellations. These Elder Beasts were revered not only for their magnificence but also for their soothing, melodic calls that resonated through the skies.<br>
The legacy of the Ababils is evident in the diverse avian life of Mysterra. Birds, eagles, and mythical creatures like griffins are all said to carry a spark of the Ababils' ancient essence. Their celestial feathers are highly sought after as magical reagents, capable of enhancing the properties of flying spells and objects.
## [[Behemoths]]
Behemoths, the colossal Elder Beasts of the land, were the unrivaled monarchs of the terrestrial realm. These massive creatures, a living embodiment of the raw power of nature, roamed the primordial landscapes with slow and deliberate steps. Behemoths are believed to be the primogenitors of the great land-dwelling beasts, including the mammoths and dinosaurs.<br>
Behemoths were titanic creatures, their bodies covered in moss, vegetation, and the ages-old scars of the earth itself. With colossal tusks and massive, gnarled horns, they commanded both fear and respect. Their lumbering gait was said to shape the very mountains and valleys they traversed.<br>
The legacy of the Behemoths can be seen in the ancient forests and the immense, elemental guardians that still roam the remote corners of the world. Their tusks and horns are highly prized for their magical properties, and shamans often craft powerful totems from these relics, channeling the Behemoths' strength and wisdom.
## [[Leviathans]]
Leviathans, the awe-inspiring Elder Beasts of the sea, were the undisputed rulers of the oceans and the depths below. These colossal serpentine creatures, with their iridescent scales and mesmerizing songs, inspired both terror and reverence. The Leviathans are considered the forebears of all sea-dwelling creatures, from the humblest fish to the most majestic sea serpents.<br>
Leviathans were titanic serpents, their bodies adorned with luminous scales that shimmered like starlight in the depths. Their powerful tails could create tidal waves with a single swipe, and their songs were said to echo through the abyss, communicating with all manner of aquatic life.<br>
The legacy of the Leviathans is ever-present in the world's oceans, as their bloodline endures in the form of merfolk, sahuagin, and other sea-dwelling races. The scales of a Leviathan, if harvested, are highly sought after as magical components, capable of enhancing the properties of water-based spells and creating powerful aquatic enchantments.
