### Passives
#### Corpse Burst
When the Rot Avatar is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
#### Putrid Aura
Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Rot Avatar must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Rot Avatar's Putrid Aura for 24 hours.
#### Spider Climb
The Rot Avatar can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
### Actions

_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
_Hit:_ 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
#### Cause Decay (Recharge 5-6)
The Rot Avatar exhales mold spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constiturion saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
