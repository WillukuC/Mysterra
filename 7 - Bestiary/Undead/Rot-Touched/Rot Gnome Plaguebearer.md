The rot gnome has advantage on all Int, Wis and Cha saving throws against magic.
#### Gift of the Rot
At the start of each of the rot gnome's turns, it regains 1d6 health.
#### Sunlight Sensitivity
While in sunlight, the rot gnome has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
#### Infectious Aura
Any creatures who start their turn within 10 ft. of the rot gnome must make a DC 12 Con saving throw.

The creature can make the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success.
