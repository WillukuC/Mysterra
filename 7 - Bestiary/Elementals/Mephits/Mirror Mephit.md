### Passives
#### Fast Healing
The mephit heals 2 points of damage each round, provided it is still alive and can see itself in a reflective surface.
#### Tendency to Shatter
The mephit takes the maximum amount of damage from bludgeoning weapons, casting the *[[Shatter|shatter]]* spell on death.
#### Spell Reflection
Any spell or effect that targets the mirror mephit and does not overcome its AC is reflected directly back at the caster or the user of the item that generated it. This new target is entitled to a saving throw if the effect permits one.
Area spells are never reflected unless they are visual effects, such as color spray. In this case, only the portion of the area that surrounds the mirror mephit is reflected; all other creatures in the area are affected normally.
#### Innate Spellcasting
The mephit's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>[!info] Spells
>*At will:* [[Mirror Image|mirror image]], [[Silent Image|silent image]]
>*1/day:* [[Simulacrum|simulacrum]]
### Actions
#### Multiattack
The mephit makes 2 attacks with its claws or darts.
#### Claw
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
*Hit:* 1 (1d4 - 1) slashing damage.
#### Glass Dart
*Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 20/60 ft., one target. 
*Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.
#### Mirror Breath (Recharge 5-6)
The mephit exhales a 20-ft.-cone of glass slivers. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 DEX save or take 5 (2d4) piercing damage, taking half on a successful save.
#### Summon Mephits (1/day)
The mephit has a 25 percent chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
