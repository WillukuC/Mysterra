## Description
Akadi is the embodiment of the element of air and goddess of elemental air, speed, and flying creatures. As an immortal being of freedom and travel, the Queen of Air instructs her followers to move as much as possible from place to place and from activity to activity.

Both the whispering wind and the turbulent tempest, sweet and moist at times while bitter and cold at others, her form changing with the seasons.
## Mythology

## Tenets and Beliefs

## Worship
In religious depictions she is often portrayed as a giant blue translucent woman with huge feathery wings that trail away in the clouds. She is revered in both male and female aspects in different parts of the world, and the distinction between these representations made no difference to her faithful. The Queen of Air's avatar usually appears as a 160 feet (49 meters) tall column of swirling winds, reminiscent of (but not actually) a giant tornado reaching into the clouds. Her voice can range in volume from the slightest breeze to an insistent squall audible for miles in every direction.
