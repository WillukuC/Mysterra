## Description
Eldest sibling and brother of [[Jethrolomeu Goodfellow]]. He is 35 years old and a member of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]]. Specifically, he is in the division of the [[Order of the Rising Sun#The Dawnwatch|Dawnwatch]], which monitors and guards discovered entrances to [[the Underdark]] that are flagged for the high activity of dangerous creatures. 
He is known as Pure-Hearted Percival because, in his earlier years as part of the order, he resisted the temptation of a group of [[Succubus|succubi]] and [[Incubus|incubi]], subsequently leading the effort to push them back from whence they came. His view of good and evil is very black and white, partially due to his direct experience fighting evils, and so he felt quite betrayed by Jethrolomeu's defection due to an association between death and, in his eyes, evil.

#### Aura of Protection
Whenever Percival or a friendly creature within 10ft. of him makes a saving throw, the creature gains a +3 bonus to the saving throw.
#### Innate Spellcasting
Percival is a 3rd-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +6 to hit with spell attacks). Percival has the following paladin spells prepared:
>[!info] Spells
>*Cantrips:* [[Light (spell)|light]], [[guidance]]
>*1st level (4 slots):* compelled duel, heroism, protection from evil and good, sanctuary, searing smite, shield of faith
>*2nd level (2 slots):* [[find steed]], gentle repose, lesser restoration, zone of truth
### Actions
#### Multiattack
Percival makes two attacks with his longsword.
#### Longsword
*Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
*Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
#### Lay on Hands
Percival may touch a creature to heal them with his pool of 30 healing points. Alternatively, 5 of those healing points may be used to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.
#### Turn the Unholy
Percival presents his dawn pendant and speaks a prayer, censuring [[Fiend]] and [[undead]] within 30 ft. Each affected creature must make a DC 14 WIS save or be turned for 1 minute.
A creature turned in this way must use its movement to move as far away from Percival as it can, and cannot take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, it takes the Dodge action.
### Bonus Actions
#### Divine Smite
Immediately after the Percival hits a target with an attack roll, he can force that target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage, or half on a successful one. This costs a 1st level spell slot.
