Demons are chaotic evil [[- Fiends -|fiends]] native to the [[The Abyss|Abyss]], ever-evolving engines of destruction spawned in its infinite depths to act as living instruments of oblivion. They were personifications of ferocity, vile perversion, and elemental devastation, existing to further the tendency of all things to slide into entropy and ruin. Barely contained by their monstrous forms, demons were creatures of raw physicality and rage, the embodiment of everything malign about chaos.
## [[Obyriths]]
The oldest of the demonic races, obyriths were ancient creatures of chaos and insanity said to have come from an entirely different reality. They ruled the Abyss for eons and were responsible for creating the tanar'ri, before an ill-fated war broke their armies and a subsequent slave revolt drove most of them into hiding or to extinction.
## [[Tanar'ri]]
The most numerous of the demonic races and the rulers of the Abyss in the modern times. The tanar'ri were born spontaneously of the Abyss, although some bore signs of being altered by sibriexes or other creatures. Tanar'ri occurred when evil mortal souls enter the Abyss; the first tanar'ri was Demogorgon.
## [[Loumara]]
Loumara demons were the youngest demonic race, consisting of immaterial beings that possessed people, creatures, or objects to spread evil. They were theorized to be born from the dreams of dead gods killed by the Abyss.
## Other Demons

### The Created
Demonic creatures created by some powerful entity, such as a demon lord or, more rarely, some other powerful entity like a night hag or a very powerful mortal spellcaster. These creatures were made from either other demons or from the raw material of the Abyss itself, but were not spontaneously created by the Abyss.

## Demon Lords
Demon Lords, or Abyssal Lords, are powerful demons that command many other demons and rule a layer of the Abyss. Each demon lord has a unique appearance and set of abilities. The most powerful demon lords were called Demon Princes. Since demons had no set hierarchy, both titles were self-proclaimed, and the demon lords and princes fought each other constantly.
