The forest from which Fern hails is presided over by the [[- Council of Lumina Thicket -|Lumina Thicket Council]], of which there are four members.
<br>In the forest there is a human tribe of druids, shamans and barbarians. Upon the appearance of the Rot, both Fern and Lonna of the Lumina tribe begin to experience Wild Magic surges. Seeing this as a call to adventure, Lonna, rather tone deaf, challenges Fern to a friendly competition: whoever heals the forest's Rot first is the victor.<br>
