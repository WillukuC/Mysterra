A crystal sphere, sometimes called a crystal shell, is a gigantic spherical shell that contains an entire planetary system. Each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that was farthest from the sun or planet at the center of the sphere (the system's primary).
