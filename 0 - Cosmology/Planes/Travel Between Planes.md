## Ethereal Curtain
Travel between the [[- Inner Planes -|Inner Planes]] and the [[- Planes of Existence -|Planes of Existence]] is possible via the [[Ethereal#Ethereal Curtains|Ethereal Curtains]] of the [[Ethereal|Ethereal Plane]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes. 
## Astral Pool
Travel between the [[- Outer Planes -|Outer Planes]] and the Planes of Existence is possible via the [[Astral#Astral Pools|Astral Pools]] of the [[Astral|Astral Plane]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes. 
## The Faeri
Travel to the Faeri can be done from the Prime via various methods, which are usually whimsical or sylvan in some sort of way. Some examples can include: 
- Mushroom circles
- Forest clearings
- Hollow logs
Travel to the Faeri is not typically noticed until after the travel has already been done, since usually the environments around the portal is identical in both the Prime and the Faeri.
## The Shadow
In contrast to travelling from the Prime to the Faeri, travelling from the Prime to the Shadow is usually done in pitch darkness, such as:
- Dark caves
- The basement of an abandoned manor
- A graveyard at midnight
Travel to the Shadow, similar to the Faeri, is not typically noticed given the darkness in which the travel is done.
