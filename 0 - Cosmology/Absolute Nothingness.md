# All From Nothing
The Void from which emerged [[the All-Maker]], its true nature is unknown to all but Itself. After the All-Maker finished creating the Multiverse, it is unknown what happened to It, although it is hypothesized that It returned to the Nothingness in order to watch its creation from a neutral and isolated home.
<br>There is debate on how the All came to be, although no evidence points to any hypotheses to be the truth. Current theories include:
- Time is cyclical, and the All-Spark emerged from the collapse of the previous multiverse.
- The All, being omnipotent, willed itself into existence from nothing.
- The All never emerged from anything for he always was and always will be, not having an inception.
# Entering the Void
To the knowledge of scholars, nobody has ever entered the Nothingness and returned. Indeed, nobody has ever entered the nothingness at all; the only way to gain access to it is likely to be invited by the All-Maker Itself. 
<br>This is not an easy feat, however; the only beings ever to have spoken to the All-Maker are certain Overgods, who are the leaders of their own pantheons.
