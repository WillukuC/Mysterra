# Description
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur
Halls carved into the roots of mountains
Echoing picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges
Commitment to clan and tradition
Burning hatred of goblins and orcs

Bold and hardy
Skilled warriors, miners, stoneworkers and metalworkers
Broad and compact
Great courage and endurance
Skin: "Deep brown" to "pale tinged with red," most commonly light brown and deep tan (earthy tones)
Hair: Thick and kept long; black, gray, brown or, if pale skin, red
Beards: Highly valued, well groomed

Live to be over 400
Perspective that shorter-lived races lack
Solid and enduring like mountains
Respect the traditions of their clan, ancestry goes back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the Broken World (post-Shattering)
Devotion to the dwarven gods, upholding the ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, stubborn. 
Strong sense of justice, slow to forget grudges.
A wrong to one dwarf is a wrong to an entire clan; one dwarf's quest for vengeance can become a clan feud.

Kingdoms stretch beneath mountains (mine gems, precious metals; forge items of wonder)
Love beauty and artistry of precious metals and jewelry
Sometimes this love becomes greed
Wealth not gained in the mountains is gained through trade
Dislike boats, so humans and halflings trade dwarven goods along water routes for them
Trusted members of other races are welcome in settlements
Some areas are off limits even to them
Clan is the chief unit of society
Highly value social standing
Cherish their own clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke ancestor's names in oaths and curses
Being clanless is the worst fate
Dwarves in other lands: artisans, esp. weaponsmiths, armorers, jewelers; sometimes mercenaries, bodyguards

>[!info] Slow to Trust
> "The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years" is a saying that points to how difficult it can be to earn a dwarf's trust for short-lived races like humans.
