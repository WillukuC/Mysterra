aliases:
  - half-orc

some rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, human blood giving them an edge
some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans
many become adventurers
achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury

grayish pigmentation, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, towering builds
heritage plain for all to see
6'-7', weigh between 180-250 lbs
regard battle scars as tokens of pride, and ornamental scars as things of beauty
others are gotten as a former slave or as a disgraced exile
those living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame

the one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs
even those who turn away from his worship can't fully escape his influence
same is true of half-orcs, though the human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage
some hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers inside
others feel the exultation when they join in melee combat, and either exult with him or shiver in fear or loathing
not evil by nature but it lurks within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it
beyond the rage of Gruumsh, they feel emotion powerfully
insults sting like acid, sadness saps their strength
laugh loudly and heartily
simple bodily pleasures (feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, wild dancing) fill them with joy
short-tempered, sometimes sullen, inclined to action more than contemplation, to fighting more than arguing
the most accomplished are those with self-control to get by in a civilized land

most often live among orcs
humans are the most likely to accept them
whether proving themselves in a barbarian tribe or scrabbling in the slums of a larger cities, they get by on their physical might, their endurance and sheer determination
