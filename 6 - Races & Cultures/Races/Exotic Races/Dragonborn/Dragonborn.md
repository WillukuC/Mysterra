# Description
Walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension
shaped by draconic gods or dragons themselves
originally hatched from dragon eggs
some are faithful servants to true dragons
other form the ranks of soldiers in great wars
others find themselves adrift with no clear calling

lack wings and tail
skin: scales, match the colors of their dragon kin, usually brass, bronze, scarlet, rust, gold, copper-green, etc
about 6.5', 300 lbs
strong hands and feet, talonlike claws, three fingers and a thumb

clan is more important than life
owe devotion and respect to their clan above the gods
conduct reflects the honor of the clan
bringing dishonor can result in expulsion and exile
knows their station and duties within the clan
continual drive for self-improvement
value skill and excellence in everything
hate to fail, push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up
pursue mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal
commitment earns the respect of a dragonborn
all strive to be self-sufficient, but recognize help is needed sometimes
best source for help is the clan
clans who need help will turn to another clan before turning to other races or even gods

clan names go first as a mark of honor before their personal names given at birth
