# Description
Dragonborns, majestic beings that stride proudly through a world rife with fearful incomprehension, are shaped by the influence of [[Draconic Pantheon|draconic gods]] or [[Dragon|dragons]] themselves. Originating from the mysterious hatching of [[dragon]] eggs, they embody a unique blend of mortal and draconic essence.
Within their diverse populace, some embrace their innate connection to dragons, serving as faithful servants to these ancient beings. Their loyalty runs deep, entwined with the grand schemes and desires of their draconic masters.
Others march into the fray of great wars, forming the formidable ranks of soldiers. With scales gleaming in the sun and hearts burning with determination, they wield their strength and prowess to tip the balance in monumental conflicts.
Yet, not all dragonborns find themselves tethered to a predefined fate. Some wander, adrift in the vast expanse of existence, grappling with the absence of a clear calling.
## Physical
Dragonborns, despite their awe-inspiring presence, lack the majestic wings and tail that one might expect from creatures of draconic lineage. Instead, their imposing stature stands at around 6.5 feet tall, with a weight of approximately 300 pounds.
Their skin, adorned with scales reminiscent of their dragon kin, bears hues that mirror the vibrant colors of brass, bronze, scarlet, rust, gold, copper-green, and other resplendent shades. Each scale reflects the lineage and heritage of the individual, a testament to the draconic influence that courses through their veins.
Their physical form is marked by strength and resilience, with hands and feet possessing a robust structure. Talonlike claws adorn their extremities, offering a formidable means of defense. Their hands, equipped with three fingers and a thumb, possess a dexterity that belies their imposing appearance.
## Society
In the realm of dragonborn society, the concept of clan reigns supreme, holding a significance that surpasses even the sanctity of life itself. From the moment of their hatching, dragonborns are instilled with an unwavering devotion to their clan, owing it respect and allegiance above even the gods themselves.
For a dragonborn, every action, every decision, is a reflection of the honor of their clan. Any hint of dishonor can lead to swift and severe consequences, potentially resulting in expulsion and exile from the clan's ranks. Thus, they conduct themselves with meticulous care, mindful of their station and duties within the clan's intricate hierarchy.
Driven by a relentless pursuit of self-improvement, dragonborns hold themselves to the highest standards, valuing skill and excellence in all endeavors. Failure is anathema to their ethos, prompting them to push themselves to the brink of exhaustion before conceding defeat. Mastery of a particular skill becomes a lifetime goal, pursued with unwavering dedication and tenacity.
Respect among dragonborns is earned through unwavering commitment and self-sufficiency, yet they understand the necessity of seeking assistance when needed. In times of trouble, the clan serves as the ultimate bastion of support, offering aid and guidance without hesitation. Indeed, within dragonborn society, the bonds of clan are unbreakable, and the collective strength of their kin is relied upon above all else, even transcending the need for aid from other races or the divine intervention of gods.
In a display of reverence and respect, dragonborns always place their clan name first, followed by their personal name given at birthâ€”a gesture that symbolizes their unwavering commitment to their clan's honor and legacy.
