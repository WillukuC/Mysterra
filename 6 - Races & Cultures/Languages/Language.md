## The Voice of the People
People in Mysterra typically communicate verbally, using the Common language that is found throughout the world. "Common" isn't any one specific language, but rather a collection of dialects that are close enough that speakers from worlds away can reasonably understand each other. 
All gods speak the same language, Supernal. The various races, of the world, having heard it differently from their appropriate gods, then adapted it into their own racial languages, such as Elvish and Dwarvish. A mortal who learns Supernal does not suddenly gain the ability to speak to all life, but it does unlock the power of the Power Words to them.
