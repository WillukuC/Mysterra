## Description
The [[fey]] pantheon is divided between two groups known as the Seelie and the Unseelie, two groups that often find themselves at odds. Seelie Fey cling to the trappings of civilization, value protocol, and uphold traditions. Unseelie Fey indulge in their primal instincts, abhor adherence to protocol, and shun conformity. The two groups are not opposites morally or ethically; good and evil Fey can be found in both.

Seelie and Unseelie Fey gather in courts. The Seelie court is called the Summer Court, and the Unseelie Court is called the Gloaming Court. Both courts stretch to the far corners of the Faerie, so their representatives can be encountered almost anywhere. The Summer and Gloaming Courts are not the only great Fey courts, but they're the most well-known to creatures on the Prime and the most widespread.

Eachcourt tries to destabilize and demoralize the other. Both Fey courts have spies who dig up dirt, sow seeds of dissent, and cause mischief. Captured spies are either ransomed or made examples of in various humiliating ways.
## History
How the Summer Court and the Gloaming Court came to be is a mystery.
## Membership
### Seelie Court
Favors sunshine, butterflies, flowers, music, and singing birds. Values ceremony and refinement (for example, proper ways of speaking, formal etiquette, and extravagant dinner parties). Favors elaborate, manufactured costuming with immaculate tailoring. Harshly judges those who don't exhibit the proper etiquette (adventurers who commit social blunders make fools of themselves, might be labeled buffoons, and might be laughed out of court).

### Unseelie Court
Favors gloom, twilight, cobwebs, fireflies, hooting owls, and croaking frogs. Values the intuitive and instinctual (for example, mystical rituals, visionaries, and firelit parties). Shuns the constraints of civilization (instead wearing only unfinished natural materials and sleeping under the stars). Dabbles in mysterious magic and rituals (adventurers can run afoul of curses if they don't follow the Unseelie ways).
