# The Nature of Religions
Deities do not exist in a vacuum in their planar homes: by definition, deities need interaction with mortals, usually expecting or demanding worship from mortal followers and expecting a certain standard of behaviour from their worshipers. Deities are the centers of religions, cults, and churches, the objects of rituals and worship, and the receivers of prayer and sacrifice. 
<br>In the multiverse, there are many different kinds of religions, each practiced by different peoples of the [[Planes of Existence|Existential Planes]].
