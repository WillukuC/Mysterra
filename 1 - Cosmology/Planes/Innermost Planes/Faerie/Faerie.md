## Cosmology
The Faerie is one of the [[Innermost Planes|innermost]] planes that overlaps the [[Prime]] and [[Umbra]]. It is connected to [[Astra]] and [[Ether]], much in the same way that the Prime is. It is sometimes seen as a reflection of the Prime, although in reality the Faerie, Prime, and Umbra were created at the same time when they were sundered from [[Initium]]. 

It occupies the same cosmological space as the Prime, its landscape more spectacular than that of the Prime. A wide, muddy river on the Prime might appear as a clear, winding brook of great beauty in the Faerie. A marsh might appear as a sinister black bog.

Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the Prime that have a near-perfect mirror in the Faerie, creating a portal where the two planes touch. A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it seems like they have simply walked into the Faerie with a step. To an observer, the traveler is there one moment and gone in an instant.

Most fey crossings open infrequently. A crossing might open only during a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing can be closed permanently if the land on either side is dramatically altered (for example, if a castle is built over a clearing on the Prime).
## Features
The Faerie is a place of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is perpetually bathed in the twilight of the ever-setting sun, with faerie lights bobbing in the breeze and large fireflies providing additional lighting in groves and fields. Visitors to the plane find that all senses, both sensory and emotional, are heightened.

The Feywild responds to unfettered emotion. It's not uncommon for flowers to turn and tremble if there's a heated argument nearby. If someone is filled with malice, their footprints might wither the grass under teir feet or cause underground insects and worms to burrow to the surface. Birds chirp merrily in the presence of those who are joyous and squawk angrily at those who are perpetually dour. 
## Planar Traits
A creature that leaves the Faerie must make a DC 10 Wis saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures that have fey ancestry, such as [[elves]]. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Faerie. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's lost memories.

While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse. Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Faerie after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. 
###### Feywild Time Warp

| 7-13  | No change           |
| 14-17 | Days become weeks   |
| 18-19 | Days become months  |
| 20    | Days become years   |
A [[wish]] spell is able to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and mught do so if the benificiaries agree to subject themselves to a [[geas]] spell and complete a quest after the wish spell is cast.
## Planar Denizens
The Faerie is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such as [[elves]], [[Dryad|dryads]], satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as [[Centaur|centaurs]] and magical creatures such as [[Blink Dog|blink dogs]], faerie dragons, treants and unicorns. The darker regions are home to malevolent creatures such as [[hags]], [[7 - Bestiary/Plants/Blight|blights]], [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Ogre|ogres]], and [[Giant|giants]].

Settled areas of the Faerie are ruled over by the Queen [[Titania]] and the [[Faerie Pantheon#Seelie Court|Seelie Court]], while the [[Faerie Pantheon#Unseelie Court|Unseelie Court]], ruled by the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], hunts their prey in the sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens beyond civilization. Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate to good and evil, although many seelie are good and many unseelie are evil. Their opposiiton stems entirely from their queens' rivalry rather than moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Faerie, such as hags and fomorians, are almost never members of either court, and independently spirited fey reject the courts entirely. The courts have warred, but they also compete in friendly contests and occasionally even ally with one another.
## Notable Locations
Some notable elven cities and settlements were located at points where the barrier between the planes was extremely thin, and a as a result existed in both the Prime and the Faerie simultaneously. Such locations include Evermeet, Evereska, and New Sharandar.

Brokenstone Vale, the Faerie kingdom of lycanthropes, attracted outcasts and refugees from across the realms of mortals. It has a long and bloodied history, having been founded by a werewolf lord that fought for his people's freedom from the neighboring eladrin. Despite its past, Brokenstone's residents garnered benefits from choosing to remain in the Faerie that were unavailable to their kin that dwelled on the Prime.

Iliyanbruen, the elven survivor-state of the ancient Mysterran realm of Illefarn was reformed in the Faerie following its near-complete destruction on Mysterra. The iliyanbruen elves were perceived as invaders by the native fey, and were forced to fight for their new home for many centuries.

Nachtur, one of the most powerful goblin kingdoms in all of the Faerie, was a labyrinth of underground warrens ruled over by the Great Gark, Lord of All the Goblins. Gark commands a host of mercenaries that serve many malevolent beings such as hags and Winter Fey lords.

Realm of Malabog, the domain of Malabog the fomorian king, extends his area of conquest beyond the Feydark into the wilderness up above.

The demiplane of SildÃ«yuir, the home of the star elves, is at times part of the Faerie, where it occupies the location that corresponds to the Yuirwood of the Prime.
### Settlements
- Astrazalian, the eladrin City of Starlight, is governed by Lady Shandria, niece of Titania.
- Cendriane, an ancient city that was taken over by the eladrin vampire named Lord Kannoth.
- Mithrendain, the Autumn City of the Faerie, was built atop a perilous passageway leading down to the Feydark below.
- Shinaelestra, the Fading City of rangers that wavered between the Faerie and the Howling Forest on Initium.
### Feydark
The Feydark is the Fey counterpart to the Prime's Underdark. Like most parts of the Faerie, it is more majestic and fantastic than its Prime counterpart, with cavernous labyrinthine tunnels filled with exotic fungi.
- Mag Tureah, the most powerful of the Feydark's fomorian realms, stood within a country-sized cavern lit by precious gems and stones. This kingdom is ruled by the fomorian king Bres.
- Vor Thomil the filthy subterranean realm is ruled by the malevolent fomorian Queen Connomae. Outsiders captured by the resident [[Giant|giants]] were mocked and humiliated for the queen's amusement, forced to masquerade as courtiers in a twisted mockery of royal assembly.
### Domains of Delight
Within the Faerie are numerous demiplanes created by the Archfey, independent realms that are each formed to reflect the whims and emotions of its creator. They grow and shrink in size depending on the power of their Archfey, occasionally leading to discontent among their leaders when borders of neighboring domains overlapped with one another.

An archfey whose Domain of Delight doesn't overlap with another's can surround their domain's border with walls of shimmering mist or some other magical effect that hides the domain from view and, if the archfey wishes, prevents creatures from entering or leaving the domain without a key, a guide, a password, the answer to a riddle, the archfey's consent, or magic.
- Prismeer, created and ruled by the archfey Zybilna. Following its takeover by the Hourglass Coven of hags, it shattered and was reformed as three splinter-realms of Hither, Thither and Yon.
- Fablerise, the gloomy forest created by Yarnspinner, an enormous fey spider that attracted myriad awakened animals with his near endless supplies of stories and tales.
