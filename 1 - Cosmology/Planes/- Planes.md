## The Known Multiverse
The multiverse is largely made up of Planes, the universes which are inhabited by the creatures, people and gods that make up its populations.
## Planar Traits
Each plane of existence has its own properties - the natural laws of its universe. Traits usually apply to the plane as a whole, but a plane is a vast place. There may be particular locations
### Physical Traits
These traits set the laws of nature, including gravity an time.
#### Gravity
##### Normal Gravity
##### Heavy Gravity
##### Light Gravity
##### No Gravity
##### Objective Directional Gravity
##### Subjective Directional Gravity
#### Time
##### Normal Time
##### Flowing Time
##### Erratic Time
##### Timeless
#### Shape and Size
##### Infinite
##### Finite
##### Self-Contained
#### Morphic Traits
##### Alterable Morphic
##### Static
##### Highly Morphic
##### Magically Morphic
##### Divinely Morphic
##### Sentient
### Elemental and Energy Traits
These traits determine the dominance of particular elemental or energy forces.
#### Air-Dominant
#### Earth-Dominant
#### Fire-Dominant
#### Water-Dominant
#### Positive-Dominant
#### Negative-Dominant
### Alignment Traits
Just as beings may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, a plane might be tied to a particular moral or ethical outlook.
#### Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned
#### Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned
#### Mildly Aligned
#### Strongly Aligned
#### Neutral-Aligned
### Magic Traits
Magic works differently from plane to plane, and these traits set the boundaries for what it can and can't do.
#### Normal Magic
#### Dead Magic
#### Wild Magic
#### Impeded Magic
#### Enhanced Magic
#### Limited Magic

## Planar Interaction
### Separate Planes
Two planes that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in different orbits. An Outer Plane, for example, may have no direct connection with the [[Prime]]. The two planes are separate, and the only way to get from one plane to the other is to go through a third plane, such as [[Astra]].
### Coterminous Planes
Planes that link together at specific points are coterminous. Think of coterminous planes as touching each other. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the other. [[Astra]] is a coterminous plane with most other planes; it exists alongside them and can be accessed from them.
### Coexistant Planes
If a link between two planes can be created at any point, the two planes are coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving in a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists with. The [[Ether]] is coexistent with the [[Prime]]. Inhabitants of the Ether can see into the Prime. With the right magic, inhabitants of the Prime can likewise see and interact with those on the Ether ([[see invisibility]] and [[magic missile]], for example, both affect the Ether).
A plane can be both coexistent and coterminous. [[Umbra]], for example, is coexistent because it overlaps with the Prime and can be accessed from there with the right spell of ability. But it's also coterminous - it's possible to enter Umbra at certain points, and travel to strange realms beyond the part of the plane that lies coexistent with the Prime.
