## Cosmology
Description of where the plane fits within the cosmology of the D&D multiverse (if applicable).
## Features
The Ether is a misty, fog-bound dimension. Its "shores," called the Border Ether, overlap the Prime and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ether. Visibility in the Border Ether is limited to 60 feet The plane's depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ether, where visibility is limited to 30 feet.
### Ether Cyclones
An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a d20 and consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect on all creatures in the vicinity.
###### Ether Cyclone
| d20   | Effect                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1-12  | Extended Journey                               |
| 13-19 | Blown to the Border Ethereal of a random plane |
| 20    | Hurled into the Astral Plane                   |
The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the Border Ether of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone tears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party into the Astral Plane.
## Planar Traits
### Border Ether
From the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into whatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid of magic.

Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can't attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don't hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ether. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ether ideal for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ether also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as easily as walking.
### Deep Ether
To reach the Deep Ether, one needs a plane shift spell or arrive by means of a gate spell or magical portal. Visitors to the Deep Ether are engulfed by roiling mist. Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a traveler to a region of the Border Ether connected to a specific Inner Plane, Prime, Faerie, or Umbra. The color of the curtain indicates the plane whose Border Ether the curtain conceals; see the Ethereal Curtains table.

Traveling through the Deep Ether to journey from one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip between planes through the Deep Ether takes 1d10 x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures are considered to move at their normal speeds.
