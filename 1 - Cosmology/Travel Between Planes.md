# Ethereal Curtain
Travel between the [[Inner Planes|Inner Planes]] and the [[Innermost Planes]] is possible via the [[Ether#Ethereal Curtains|Ethereal Curtains]] of [[Ether]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes. 
# Astral Pool
Travel between the [[Outer Planes|Outer Planes]] and the Planes of Existence is possible via the [[Astra#Astral Pools|Astral Pools]] of [[Astra]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes. 
# [[Faerie]]
Travel to Faerie can be done from the Prime via various methods, which are usually whimsical or sylvan in some sort of way. Some examples can include: 
- Mushroom circles
- Forest clearings
- Hollow logs
Travel to Faerie is not typically noticed until after the travel has already been done, since usually the environments around the portal is identical in both the Prime and Faerie.
# [[Umbra]]
In contrast to travelling from the Prime to Faerie, travelling from the Prime to Umbra is usually done in pitch darkness, such as:
- Dark caves
- The basement of an abandoned manor
- A graveyard at midnight
Travel to Umbra, similar to Faerie, is not typically noticed given the darkness in which the travel is done.
# Elemental Vortices
Permanent two-way pathways that existed between the elemental planes, or an elemental plane and the Prime.
# Infinite Staircase
# Cross-Planar Rivers
## Oceanus
A river that connects several [[The Upper Planes|upper planes]], whose source is located in [[Thalasia]]. From there, it flows through [[Belierin]], [[Eronia]], [[Amoria]], [[Krigala]], [[Arvandor]], and finally [[Aquallor]], where maelstroms at the bottom of the infinite ocean transported travelers back to the river's headwaters in Thalasia. 
## Styx
A river that connects several lower planes, crawling through the uppermost layers of the seven lower planes. Those who drank or touched the water risked forgetting their past lives temporarily or permanently. Its headwaters were in [[Pandesmos]], from where it flowed into the [[1 - Plain of Infinite Portals|Plain of Infinite Portals]], [[Othrys|Orthrys]], [[Oinos]], [[Khalas]], [[Avernus]], and [[Avalas]], before reaching its final destination of [[Ocanthus]], where the lost memories claimed by the river remain, trapped by the ice.
