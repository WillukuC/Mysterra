## Borders
Borders allow movement between the planes in a smooth, almost uneventful manner. Travelers may not be aware of the boundary and slip unaware over a planar border into a new dimension. Such borders may be patches of darkness, banks of fog, or driving rainstorms. Sometimes one plane gives way to another plane so gradually that it's impossible to tell where the border region starts and ends.
Vision across a border may be limited by the nature of the plane or the border (such as being caught in a fog bank), but it is not inherently impeded.
### Firm Borders
Firm borders have a set boundary between one plane and the next, such as a cliff in one plane hanging over a chasm in another plane, or farmland that suddenly gives way to jungle. Magic does not cross firm borders; nothing on the far side of the border can be targeted by a spell unless that spell specifically affects targets on other planes.
### Soft Borders
Soft borders have less determinate edges, and often exist where similar portions of each plane connect. his forms a buffer zone or "quasi-plane" that belongs to both planes yet has an identity and planar traits of its own. Magic crosses the buffer zone into each of the planes.
### Shifting Borders
Shifting borders are the most perilous to travelers because they move back and forth. Similar to the tidal zone of the seashore, sometimes the border area belongs to one plane, sometimes to the other. Magic treats a shifting border as a firm border, but there is a risk that the border will shift, stranding the traveler on the wrong side of the border and in a dangerous plane.
### Planar Paths
Planar paths, unique to individual cosmologies, cross multiple borders to connect a number of planes. The change from plane to plane is not always obvious (similar to a soft border). Making the trip means little more than moving normally along the path - no spells or items are required.
Two great rivers serve as planar paths through the [[Outer Planes]]. The River Oceanus moves through the celestial planes; the dark, foreboding River Styx flows through the fiendish planes.
#### River Oceanus
A river that connects several [[The Upper Planes|upper planes]], whose source is located in [[Thalasia]]. From there, it flows through [[Belierin]], [[Eronia]], [[Amoria]], [[Krigala]], [[Arvandor]], and finally [[Aquallor]], where maelstroms at the bottom of the infinite ocean transported travelers back to the river's headwaters in Thalasia. 
#### River Styx
A river that connects several [[The Lower Planes|lower planes]], crawling through the uppermost layers of the seven lower planes. Those who drank or touched the water risked forgetting their past lives temporarily or permanently. Its headwaters were in [[Pandesmos]], from where it flowed into the [[1 - Plain of Infinite Portals|Plain of Infinite Portals]], [[Othrys|Orthrys]], [[Oinos]], [[Khalas]], [[Avernus]], and [[Avalas]], before reaching its final destination of [[Ocanthus]], where the lost memories claimed by the river remain, trapped by the ice.
#### Infinite Staircase
## Spells
The most common method of travel between planes of existence is through spells and magic items. Many spells use planar energies and the nature of the planes themselves.
The [[Ether]] may be accessed by the [[etherealness]] spell, which take the individual's body physically into that plane. The [[astral projection]] spell is the ticket to [[Astra]]; the spell separates an astral form from the caster's body. The [[shadow walk]] spell allows movement through [[Umbra]] to cover great distances on the [[Prime]].
### Plane Shift
The most common way to travel between the planes is via the 7th level spell [[Plane Shift|plane shift]].

## Magic Portals
"Portal" is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection. Portals, which include such related items as vortices and gates, open at one location on the originating plane and at one location on the destination plane (or planes).
Portals are created by many sources. Some are simply large magic items, linking the two planes (or two locations within the same plane). Others exist naturally. And the deities themselves have created some portals.
Most portals, regardless of their nature and origin, share a number of properties. They provide instantaneous transportation from one location to another. If they pass through Astra, they form conduits, impenetrable tubes that burrow through that open plane.
## Ethereal Curtain
Travel between the [[Inner Planes|Inner Planes]] and the [[Innermost Planes]] is possible via the [[Ether#Ethereal Curtains|Ethereal Curtains]] of [[Ether]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes. 
## Astral Pool
Travel between the [[Outer Planes|Outer Planes]] and the Planes of Existence is possible via the [[Astra#Astral Pools|Astral Pools]] of [[Astra]], each of which allow passage to the bordering Planes.
