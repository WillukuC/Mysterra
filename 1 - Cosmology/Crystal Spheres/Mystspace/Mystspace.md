The crystal sphere that houses the Mysterran system. It houses its star, Lustre, which is orbited by the planets of Svithinn, Vaxtvarl, Mysterra, Hafraent, and Kalduris. 
- [[Lustre]], the sphere's star. The many sun gods of Mysterra share this star, as its big enough to house all of them.
	- [[Svithinn]], a land scorched by Lustre's intense heat, proving uninhabitable by most creatures. If the heat doesn't kill them, then the intense sandstorms, lightning strikes, and volcanic activity will.
	- [[Vaxtvarl]], a green planet covered in vegetation. It is rumored that it is comprised of plants down to its very core.
	- [[Mysterra]], the main planet of Mystspace. Over 6000 years ago it suffered the Shattering by Magnus the Archmage, now a historical figure for his sacrifice and gift of magic to all of Mysterra.
		- [[Argentil]], the Silver Moon.
		- [[Sehanine]], the Elven Moon.
		- [[Hayawan]], the Beast Moon.
		- [[Duendosc]], the Dark Moon.
	- [[Hafraent]], an oceanic planet that features water hundreds of miles deep. Settlers have ships on the surface, and some are even rumored to live on the bottom of the ocean, if it exists. 
	- [[Kalduris]], the polar opposite of Svithinn. It is an equally uninhabitable freezing landscape, battered by the winds that shape its snow dunes.
